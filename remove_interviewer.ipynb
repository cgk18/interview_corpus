       " 'Participant 1 ',\n",
       " 'Interviewer: Okay, so I wanted to begin with just some basic demographic information background. Can you just give me a little summary of who you are and your education and employment history?',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Okay I'm (Participant 1). Originally I'm from Japan, I came to United States 1991 or so and as an exchange student um at the college. And I graduated four year college in computer information systems and I moved to Georgia to be a part of Olympic game, but before that I uh I worked and then so after the Olympic Game, I continue to work at the same company as a full time there. Uh, uh but meanwhile I got the green card, so I moved uh I got a more professional job at Macy's so I moved to Macy's 1999 and since then I'm with Macy's um over 23 years.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: wow yeah. Wait, were you in the Olympics?',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Yes, no, no, no I'm part of the Olympic game. And my kids um my childhood dream was to be an Olympian. So and then um I was in Alabama um and then, since Olympic was coming, so I was thinking even I cannot be Olympian how I can work there? So I sign for a volunteer, and then I was closer than those uh tennis players, because I was working at the VIP room. So I can watch the game in a good condition, instead of like staying outside.\",\n",
       " \"Interviewer: awesome yeah that's really, that's a good idea to work for the Olympics. \",\n",
       " 'Participant 1: Yes. It was cool.',\n",
       " 'Interviewer: um so, can you tell me a little bit about your current job and what like role you play and a little bit more about the organization or the company?',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Okay, so, as you know, Macy's we are retail, like um department store, and I'm in a logistics area uh working for distribution center. I'm a software um senior software engineer, and then I um I work on any kind of issue around the consultation system at the um eleven different distribution Center across the um um US. So to set up the conveyor um system and also support. \",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: gotcha',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: and then now I'm moving to more like warehouse management or online business, the area I’m working I used to work at is um how merchandise can move from vendor to stores through the DC now I'm going to the um the online business.\",\n",
       " \"Interviewer: Oh okay, that makes sense, but still within Macy's?\",\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Right mmhmm. But they're like all transport station, distribution, and then so like have you ever heard about the robot um in a distribution center? So before like uh so if you go to Costco there is a merchandise and above it there is a big um uh the bulk of merchandise, so if the toilet paper is almost gone, the forklift like come down and then put a um bunch of toilet papers, so that is our old system. Now it's gonna be like big scaled on of building and then each big box has like certain kinds of merchandise, and then the robot it keeps moving around and bringing the merchandise to fulfill the um online orders. So that’s a building but those like build, scale from building within the building and then the merchandise is coming to the person standing and then they're going to say, ‘Oh this person ordered shoes, this one, and then this person ordered, same person, ordered shirt,’ so, the—um, all the box is coming to this person's area, so all she need to do is okay pick one, okay scan, put it in a box, or this shirt is too, scan too. And then so that's that's a new type of uh um distribution for um um for online orders, but before it was like human being is like going through, but now it’s uh everything's automatic.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: Got it. So, with that sort of job, are you working with a lot of other people, and do you, are you managing some of those people as well?',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: No, uh I directly work with—uh so that is for new system, so I um I deal with more third-party um vendors and then engineers so because that's new. But my um, my previous um this works, um work uh responsibility change happened last week but for years...\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: wow.',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: yes, all of a sudden it changed, but so like previously, I was dealing with distribution to store um environment and I deal with the person directly, but these people are the people who are working at the DC. Most likely they may have a college degree, or no, they may have a high school degree, they may not. So I say one things, like this is like normal for me, but they don't understand, so I have to explain different, different things based on the person I'm talking to. If it’s manager, I can say more technical stuff, but if somebody is saying, ‘This doesn't work,’ so like I have to ask, ‘Would you tell me what, what are you seeing? What did you do?’ I have to ask them one of the time, like ‘Did you press this?‘ ‘Oh no I didn't do it.’ ‘Well, you, you, you missed that one step so that's why it doesn't work.’ So I work with a variety of people um for the problem.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: That‘s so interesting. For the problem, so you’re solving a lot of problems every day.',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Yes, right, yes. But if I'm designing something it's like I'm talking to engineering and um more um educated people. \",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: got it. ',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: But no offense but, like so that's why like different types, type of people.\",\n",
       " \"Interviewer: yeah sure um when when you're having these interactions, are, do you ever feel like you or the other person is getting, like, emotional or experiencing certain emotions like frustration or um anything else?\",\n",
       " \"Participant 1: [laugh] Yes, of course, because um, so we have an East coast and in too Hawaii and you can tell that, depend on the DC that, based on the location, that people is different. That, like for like, for example, New Jersey people they talk so fast, and before I mean I grew up in like I had been living in Georgia/Alabama so we, we talk slowly. And then and in top of it I'm uh like this is my second language, so, but people in New Jersey or New York, no matter what they speak so fast.\",\n",
       " \"And and then, so they were asking, they were uh kind of not irritated because they have to listen to me, so, but I can tell on the phone they say like quick-quick-quick-quick-quick like what are you talking about, get the point. On the other hand, certain area um oh, Texas, Texas has a different personality, they say, ‘I‘m number one, I’m number one,’ like no, you are not number one, your DC, it is small but they say ‘No I'm priority number one.’ No I have other DC they are completely stopped, a hundred people are not working, and so they don't listen. And uh Hawaii, they are very laid back, they say, ‘Oh, okay, what do you see. Oh, let me see.’ Well, no you called me, you have an issue, please get the things together. [Laugh]\",\n",
       " \"So uh yeah so that frustration could be that the person who is asking me question because I'm not getting the um the point quick. Sometime it's other way. Hawaii people, it’s so slow but it's their part—their, it's their culture, no matter who I'm talking to over there it's that way.\",\n",
       " \"Interviewer: Um so when you experience these emotions, uh do you feel like you're able to express your frustration, or do you try to like withhold or constrain it?\",\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Okay, so it depends on the person, because I have been working um here for long, so some of the DC people, I know that they they were like 20s, now their 40s. So I asked them if they are having a same issue like, ‘Come on, I told you like 20 years ago, and you are still having this issue. You supposed to know.’ So like I have this kind of attitude, well I'm just joking to them, but I kind of express you supposed to know by now what to do, instead of calling me. Um, but if it's like higher people I try to hide. And also my difference is when I started work because I don't have uh confidence, um I control my emotion a lot. Right now, I'm higher position, and uh I know I'm the only one person who can solve. So that's why I express my emotions sometimes, especially to the people I know I'm familiar with.\",\n",
       " \"Interviewer: That makes sense, yeah. What about when you're talking with the engineers or more technical people, instead of like troubleshooting like the problem at the DCs?\",\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Um, well because everybody talks different way, because um the technical people, they may not have emotion. And so they, or they talk too detailed so I'm not frustrated just my eyes are like rolled like what are you talking about, uh that type. And so uh but before I’m frustrated most likely that case because usually that kind of, that time we are talking as a group, so other people already express their frustration before me, so I just sit back and they’re like ‘Okay he's not making sense or he just talking about mumbo jumbo,’ like somebody better stop and uh we look at each other, ‘Who gonna say it,’ that kind. But if it's like uh like the senior vice president is talking about then, even I'm frustrated, just I have those blank face like okay I'm listening. I shouldn’t say anything.\",\n",
       " \"Interviewer: Sure, yeah yeah. [laugh] In terms of, you've talked a little bit about differences by location, do you notice any differences based on like race or gender or age?\",\n",
       " 'Participant 1: Well one of the experience I had was with Indian people. Um right now, those Indian um people are like everywhere in tech and our field. But before, I mean they already had the immigrants, but um we started to have more offshore resource, and at the time, some male um contractors, they refused to work with me. I’m uh',\n",
       " 'Interviewer: oh really? ',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Mhmm. And then I said I'm a big lead. I design and you have to listen to me, because this is how it's work. And there was a male coworker who is working with me, and then, but he cannot design, and then, but he's older than me I'm younger and female, I‘m Asian. And then so, this contractor, it is a one who has to get all the information I'm providing and ship to offshore and then that person refuse to listen. And then so he was asking to my coworker uh to ask for the detail, but this person cannot explain, and so I had a meeting with him including manager, if you don't want to walk with me you, better like find another job and he left. So...\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: oh wow.',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Yes, so, but that was like 2004/2005 or 6 so it's, he was about like 40 something years old, and I was still like early 30s. Well no no, mid-30s. And then so um that was the time and other than that, I didn’t have much issues um because of the culture or gender.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: Okay yeah no. Um, can you tell me a little bit more about the demographics just of the people in all the different places you work, you know, all like the engineers and the managers and the distribution center workers, etcetera. ',\n",
       " 'Participant 1: So distribution center we have uh uh Hawaii and uh uh West Coast is um. Baltimore area, um like Boston area and New York. Uh Ohio. Um Florida. Um uh Stone Mountain. Houston. Outside of Chicago. Did I say Houston? Hayward uh which is close to um Sacramento, Los Angeles. [unintelligible] um close to Seattle and then Hawaii. And then so those are the people I usually work but the technical side is like local people, most likely Georgia.',\n",
       " 'Interviewer: Georgia people. So do they tend to be Asian also are they…',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: No, no uh, these days, the people I work with within um Macy's in Atlanta it's Indian. \",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: mostly Indian. ',\n",
       " 'Participant 1: I cannot tell—I cannot whether it‘s female or male because the name I cannot recognize, it’s male. Before it was...',\n",
       " \"Interviewer: So you don't see them or talk to them?\",\n",
       " \"Participant 1: No, I talk to them. Um but until then because, just like because we don't call um we use a ping so, um, based on the name I cannot tell the gender because, because the name is not fami—it's not John or Tom, it's [Indian name] like said okay. \",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: Sure, sure sure. ',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: So, but I started to work like more over 10 years so like this name is could be male, this could be female, but usually it's male. I don't see many um female um uh Indian female in a technical field, but they are more like testers. And then um uh, so, for example, when I started to work at Macy's um there are not many Asians and then um maybe we had about 10.\",\n",
       " \"And then Asian female was about 5 and then 2 of them are half Asian, half American. And then the pure Asian, like me, was 3 or 4. And after 9/11 uh company doesn't support. So immediately Russian, Taiwanese, Chinese, they couldn't uh um continue so they had to leave. And then um the economy getting better and instead of hiring uh full-time people they have contractors, because of the experience of the 9/11 they had to let go so many people. It's better to have a contractor so that case they can cut people immediately. Then those Indian contractors came.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: got it and, and now you would say that there are quite a few Asians in your in your work?',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Yes, but-but mostly it's Indian so contractor’s team is all Indian and then meanwhile, we also have more uh Indian full-time people. And then uh recently I see more non-Indian Asian, and then they are younger generation, not like 40 something years old with experience. They are the current grads, like new grads are joining.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: gotcha. Yeah um what, how big is your company like how many people are working with you on a regular basis?',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: I don't know because we are on remote, so yesterday’s, yeah, yester—. Like we used to have a cubicle so like we know like 400/500 in a building, we had three different building. I was in one building so, but these two others like we have a main building and my building was next to each other, so I can guesstimate, but we also have another building um out in John's Creek so we don't, we didn't know. But uh one time it's 600—that's a question, you may want to ask [name], she may know more.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: Okay, yeah I can do that.',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: But yeah but uh yesterday’s um some social function people's, people sign up for 400 so there was a ice cream social in uh the building...\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: oh wow.',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: So, they can, yeah, and then they can go there and then just enjoying the atmosphere, like I don't know what kind of activities. I didn't go, but I heard about 400 people said they gonna be there, but there also the people, the engine working from home, so they won't—they didn't go.\",\n",
       " \"Interviewer: got it and then so do you have social activities like that regularly, would you say that that's like a pretty common thing?\",\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Um yes, they do um. Um I don't know I don't count because usually I don't attend so. [laugh] Yes, because I have like young child. And then the bus is coming, so like even my office is just five minutes away, no bus is coming, I better stay at home. And I don't want to take my daughter to those social function. It may be good, but then I have to introduce everybody, like, ‘This is my daughter, nice to meet you,’ and so I have to support the system so like no I won't go, um.\",\n",
       " \"So, but I think it's every two months or so, they have functionality, some function to get together or we have a meeting, so people want to be there, um like face to face but building is too small b...\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: W- um...',\n",
       " 'Both: sorry.',\n",
       " 'Interviewer: no, no go on.',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Oh yeah so we have a meeting like for the technical people get together. And then, so the boss is going to talk about the way people want to be there, and so, but uh... We have too many people so that's what not everybody can go, but after that they also have some social activities. So almost every two months they have some kind of event.\",\n",
       " \"Interviewer: Would you say that the environment and, like, the culture of the organization's pretty friendly then or like laid back or…?\",\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Um, not laid back, it's-it's competitive. Before it’s...\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: really?',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: yes, it's before it's more friendly and it's like a family, we used to say ‘Macy's family’ but I don't feel that way. But they always say like, ‘How do you feel?’ but the reason I'm saying is my husband passed away uh when my daughter is nine months old and then um… And then uh [to child offscreen] nine yes, you, you are nine months old, yeah. \",\n",
       " '[Child babbles offscreen]',\n",
       " \"Okay, and, and then uh so, so my team was very supportive because before that I have to um um I have to take care of him before he died, and I was also, the um, leave. And then people understand and then they cover me and then but now, I don't feel like that. I used to have like a group of people who can support me, but now it's not like that, it's if I look at sideway, somebody may shoot me from from the back.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: Oh no.',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: No, I mean it sounds bad, but it's that way. And then um because it's technology so they want to, they have their own agenda, ‘I came to this company to do this,’ so they wanna uh they want to succeed, to accomplish. But at the same time, that design doesn't work based on the current um uh current system so that's why you have to take step by step to do. And then but they don't want to listen, ‘No, you have an old mind so that's why like no we gonna go the new way.’ How many projects went that way, and then it doesn't work well because they don't listen. So that's why because you are like complaining person so that's why I don't let you in. And then like I will not invite you a meeting. And then, if I have a question I will ask you specific question, but people when they ask a question, they don't tell you exactly why they're asking, so we asked them—or not only me, but the people, my team—asked, ‘Why are you asking? What are you trying to do? Then you are asking this question,’ they said ‘No, no I'm asking this so um please answer me,’ so I answer it, and then they will take that word think like ‘Oh [Participant 1] said that.’ Well, but you didn't say you are doing this. If I know the whole things, then I will say no, but they say, ‘No, no, no, I don't want to hear whole things.’ So, that's why I'm saying um uh like if I look, turn around and it's something is building doesn't work, so.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: got it yeah so people take things out of context and stuff pretty regularly.',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Mhmm but before it was not like that, like we are same team, because we are here to build something good so let's get together and understand. And then, so like, everybody understand what is going on, so uh everybody's voice was important, but I don't feel that way. It’s more like...\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: When would you say that shift happened—sorry.',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Uhh... the management changed. Mhm, so I don't know [name] told you or not. One day the Delta people came and then they said, this is the best solution, and then they said... so my very smart person in my team said one things and they said—and then the management shut him down immediately, because his question was valid and it does need to be answered because I'm dealing with saltation, so. I don't know you saw the scanner or not box it's moving so quick and the scanner is reading it. And then so that's why this data need to be processed so quick. If it's late, if any kind of like uh latency we gonna have an issue so that's why like how many seconds, you can process data. And he said that very fast, ‘Well, no, no, we are talking about how many like percentage how many...’ and then they said, uh he said, this person uh shut him down in front of everybody.\",\n",
       " \"And then um uh, so, because big management is saying that, so we also see that regular management is saying. It's like uh swinging on trees. If this person says A and then so that's why, like all the trees are going to swing this way. And then but this person says like-like this. He is completely going wrong way, but many of the team is already saying, deciding this course is going swinging this way, but like we are going this, the other side. They’re like criticizing especially like our immediate manager is criticizing.\",\n",
       " \"And then, some people were let go during that time, so that's why people said shut up because, like it's a recession going on, I don't want to lose job. So if somebody said look right side, well we're going to look right side, if you, so...\",\n",
       " \"Interviewer: Do you feel like concerned, sometimes like, if you complain, or you say something, you know don't just follow directions, like that is, that's not a good thing, because you might get in trouble?\",\n",
       " 'Participant 1: Yes. Mhmm.',\n",
       " \"Interviewer: Okay that's...\",\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Yes, because um I'm PPs so that's why like at this moment I’m kind of like, ‘Why do I need to fight?’ And then so it may not be a good way, but—and then because, like we fought—and then, because so like I was asking what are you trying to do, like tell me your design and it's gonna work or not. So like please be in a meeting and I have to ask so many different people. Um so I reach out to the um distribution center side, something it is going on and it's going to impact to you, but the team who is changing is not involving me. So the DC people are telling them ‘No, she has to be there,’ it took seven months to be in and a so finally starting from this month, I was in that meeting, then my management said ‘No, no, no, you don't need to be in you're going to move to another area.’ Even I spend almost like more than half a year to fight to get in what is going on, so.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: Do you feel like they moved you because you were you were fighting to get in?',\n",
       " 'Participant 1: No its different. ',\n",
       " 'Interviewer: oh no, not really. Okay.',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Yeah, well, the reason it is the one person is going to retire and then he has an origin of the certain area and then we're going to convert that DC like a robotic one. So that's why we need to have somebody, so they moved me.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: got it, yeah. For the, I guess, it was a manager who got shut down at the meeting, the person who was very smart. Um was he, like what race was he and what age was he?',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: he's uh he's white male and he is about 40/45 at the time, well 42 or so, he's a year younger, uh he's one year younger than-uh older than me.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: got it. Yeah okay',\n",
       " 'Participant 1: And then because he is uh like extremely smart person in our group or in our area if he going to be shut down, nobody gonna say. ',\n",
       " 'Interviewer: mm, yeah. ',\n",
       " 'Participant 1: and so, and then but only one person complained again after him and then he was let go.',\n",
       " 'Interviewer: oh wow',\n",
       " 'Participant 1: But, but this, but this manager was, management is gone also—later on.',\n",
       " 'Interviewer: So, you have a different management now.',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: yeah, different management. And then now it's Home Depot people came, Home Depot's person came in and everybody say, ‘Oh, this is the best one.’ And then how many our Senior Vice President in technical field changed. And then the um because top management is keep changing, and then they have uh to they have a different direction. So, and then those management is high management is bring his own favorite people, so we have so many Home Depot people and then now that management is gone. So, so...\",\n",
       " \"Interviewer: Interesting. So there's a lot of change, huh?\",\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Yes, they brought that culture to Macy's and uh I have a friend who used to um who has been working at uh Home Depot. One time, they said, ‘Do not come to Home Depot, it's horrible,’ and then they said, ‘Oh it's easier, now.’ And then and I said, ‘Guess what, because they’re in Macy’s now.’\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: So, they brought all their people to Macys.',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: I won't say all but uh since they... many people left from um Home Depot people so that's why culture changed. Because the uh some water, the new water is coming in, so like maybe the bucket of water is clear.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: Mm. Got it. Um. So, if you could sum up in like a few words what the culture is now at your job, what would you say?',\n",
       " 'Participant 1: Competitive and uh... uh... quick, fast.',\n",
       " 'Interviewer: Competitive and quick. If you could rate it on a scale from like 1 to 10 in terms of how much you like your job, 10 being the best and 1 being the worst, what number would you give it? [laugh]',\n",
       " 'Participant 1: [Laugh] Um, 7, because... ',\n",
       " \"Interviewer: that's pretty high.\",\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Well, because I like what I'm doing. \",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: yeah.',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: And uh I like challenging stuff, I enjoy learning but the stuff I don't like is the culture. And then also it's too fast, if I'm consuming my work quick, it's just keep piling it. And then um it days um working, working a lot, uh it’s not um, it's not good. So, I tried to shut down since I’m working from home, I can log on and, but at the same time, I can do the um the laundry or something during the break time. But there is no uh limits. And then since but I'm the type of person I said, ‘I'm done,’ so I gonna quit. If there is more jobs, it can wait. I'm not a brain surgeon, nobody's dying. And then, but on the other hand, some people working all weekend too. The person I'm always working with she has like two years old and five years old kids and she's always online, and then that’s ridiculous. And then by the way, she's Asian. And then she said...\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: she’s Asian too. ',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Well, she is extremely type-A, and then like in there, like I'm a director, I need to know, and this so like she's digging and digging. So, she was identifying one issue and then so she's reaching out to me and uh I pointed out three different issues, so now she need to handle all different type of issue. Eh and then, and then like today, I had a meeting with her for two hours and then like, ‘Jane you are sick, you have to, like, get well.’ \",\n",
       " \"‘Oh no, I have to do this, I have to do this.’ And then she is overachiever, but she doesn't know how to control her time, but I think I'm older and also my position, I have to put my daughter uh in a higher um position. She has a husband and also family member, so that's why they're taking of the kids, but it's still not good as a mother. She need to be there, she has to cook. But her mother is cooking for the family. So. \",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: I see, yeah. Um, this is just a person you work with on a regular basis?',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Yes, so she is a distri- um she is the one who is controlling all the DCs, so if there is any kind of, um, so like small issues uh, so, at first, she has to investigate so everybody is going through her and then it gonna come to me. But she tries to resolve lots of issues, but some of them, she shouldn't do it. She has also her team, but she said, ‘My team is slow, so I have to—I have to do it.’\",\n",
       " \"And then—no, no, no, no—I have offshore team and they go, ‘But [Participant 1] those people are slow.’ Well, guess what they have to write, and then they are well paid but, since you are doing their job, so that's why they will never understand. So, but she's extremely overachiever, so she she doesn't listen.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: yeah that sounds a little difficult sometimes.',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: And then I’m surprised she's not the first generation she's a second generation. I thought she is more laid back, more Americanized, no offense to you, I think you are that. [laugh] You are second generation right?\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: [shakes head] I’m actually first also.',\n",
       " 'Participant 1: What! Really? Wow! But your English is so well.',\n",
       " 'Interviewer: Oh, but yeah, so I was born in South Korea, but I was adopted so. [laugh]',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Oh, okay. [laugh] Okay, so her case it is like not, I think she is a third generation her grandparents came so her mother was, um, um her mother was like teenager. And then so she's a third generation, but she grew up and her mother is also grew up here so, but they have uh some, but they have a like keep the tradition. And then, but she, she will not, she's—she's a tiger mom’s daughter.\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: Uh, where is she from? Um where did...',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Uh her—her parents, she's Chinese, but I don't kn—her parents, her grandparents are from China, or Hong Kong, or I don't know exactly. \",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: I see, yeah. No that makes sense.',\n",
       " 'Participant 1: But she said her mom was tiger mom. She has to achieve.',\n",
       " \"Interviewer: Got it, yeah. Yeah. Um so I have just a couple more questions for you. Um one of them is, since this is a study sort of about emotions um in the workplace, what kind of a person are you emotionally? Like do you think that you're an emotional person, uh do you tend to openly share your feelings with others? This can be at work or in general.\",\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Mhm. I'm more sharing my emotion. If I'm mad, I'm mad. My—but uh I will uh choose the person to share. I will ask my friend to come, like, ‘Can you like go outside, just take a walk?’ And then um uh I will share. But if I'm really mad, they will know based on the tone of voice. And then my team going to come to my cubicle and they were saying like, ‘Calm down,’ that type.\",\n",
       " \"Interviewer: And do you ever feel like you get in trouble, or do you feel like it's effective if you are expressing your emotions sometimes?\",\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Um, uh, not—not all the time um because before, one time um when I was younger uh maybe uh I was becoming a senior programmer uh, my manager said um, ‘We decided, we decided, we decided,’ and then he said um I couldn't—all he was saying that I shouldn't get the promotion. And then, so I was so upset, and I was said, like, ‘I don't speak French! Like, who is we?’ \",\n",
       " \"That's what I said, and I felt so bad. [Laugh] And then that's, that's a bad example, I showed my expression, but I thought it was okay because his attitude was um not professional. So, uh but in my circumstance now, I shouldn't show my emotion too much because the people I'm working with could be a contractor, so they cannot say no to me. So, I try to be more calm and then um, like encouraging. And they—if they are not doing good, then I will do it short and sweet but tell them, ‘You are not doing good, you have to do this,’ type.\",\n",
       " \"Interviewer: Sure, yeah. Can you think of any specific times or like scenarios, where you felt particularly emotional—I mean other than the, I guess that was, you just shared one, so that's a good example, but at work?\",\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Um at work um... well it's not related to work, but I express my emotions at uh, at office or on a call. Like, for example, like the recent one is abortion um and then it's a very sensitive topic and then that the very smart guy and then his name is [name] and he's uh, uh he's gay. And then um I was talking to him and then because he's also like interested in politics, so like we shared and uh I was so against um uh the decision, they made because they're overturn the law so that means it is anything it's already decided could be turned over. So that means is like those gay rights um law gonna be turned over. So, something happened and then, so that's why I’m showing more emotion uh, with him, or like certain topic, but it's not related to um work too much. But we don't do that, like on uh chat, something like it will be recorded or noted. We will call each other and then so um because these people, we also have like another course people and then that time we call each other, and then we share, because those are the people we have been working together and then we feel familiar, we know each other, we know the um their circumstance.\",\n",
       " \"Interviewer: that's great. I'm glad you have those people.\",\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Yes, so so because we are working from home sometime especially single people, they may not talk all day long. So [name], he said, like around five o'clock he said, ‘You are the first person I talk today.’ Like ‘[Name] you didn't talk to anybody today?’ ‘Yes.’ [laugh]\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: That can be very isolating. Yeah. ',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Yeah, yeah so, so that's why he's also like calling me, like, ‘Do you have time,’ like, ‘I'm so bummed,’ sort of ‘I just want to explain, or like somebody to listen to me.’ So...\",\n",
       " \"Interviewer: Sure. Yeah, yeah no that makes sense. Um so that's actually all of my questions I—the only last question is just is there anything else about your workplace or your job that we haven't discussed that you would want to talk about?\",\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Mm, not really. Uh, like I said something bad things too but overall I'm pretty positive person and then even I complain. I enjoy working I like what I'm doing, it's challenging, fast. I wish it sometimes it's a little bit slower, so I can smell the flower but guess what, at this moment I’m so glad I still have job with good pay. Even I'm single mom I can support myself and my kids too, so um no complaint.\",\n",
       " \"Interviewer: Sure, yeah well I'm glad that's good. Um thank you so, so much for doing this um I yeah, you were actually my first interview so I’m very excited.\",\n",
       " 'Participant 1: Oh okay! So, do you have a like a different, you want to have uh like a specific gender or, like you, are you interested female or um...',\n",
       " \"Interviewer: Um yeah, so I'm interested in a mix, a diverse group of people...\",\n",
       " 'Participant 1: Mixed? Okay.',\n",
       " 'Interviewer: yeah so different ethnic backgrounds, different genders. They could be a different role/positions or different companies too. Any of those would be interesting to me.',\n",
       " 'Participant 1: Okay sounds good, because this month, was an Asian awareness month and then uh, so I was working with some Asian association in Georgia. ',\n",
       " 'Interviewer: oh okay.',\n",
       " \"Participant 1: Uh so, I can pass that information because, and uh also because I don't want to pass to the Macy's people too much so, because otherwise you will hear all the Macy's people. Yeah, but I can select certain people and then like maybe they might be interested in, because they are uh located in New York, but I think if I pass this information to that organizations um, she's a publication um chair and then she knows lots of people, so you maybe uh good response\",\n",
       " 'Interviewer: that would be amazing. Yeah that would be so awesome.',\n",
       " 'Participant 1: okay, okay. Sounds good. Okay sounds good. ',\n",
       " 'Interviewer: Um should I email you, I mean I guess I already emailed you the flyer and you can send that out.',\n",
       " 'Participant 1: yeah, yeah. [name] send me a flyer so I will forward it to you, CC you, so if um she has a question then she um or she can pass that information to her group. Then they can reach out to you. ',\n",
       " 'Interviewer: thank you so much that would be amazing',\n",

So before like uh so if you go to Costco there is a merchandise and above it there is a big um uh the bulk of merchandise, so if the toilet paper is almost gone, the forklift like come down and then put a um bunch of toilet papers, so that is our old system. Now it's gonna be like big scaled on of building and then each big box has like certain kinds of merchandise, and then the robot it keeps moving around and bringing the merchandise to fulfill the um online orders. So that’s a building but those like build, scale from building within the building and then the merchandise is coming to the person standing and then they're going to say, ‘Oh this person ordered shoes, this one, and then this person ordered, same person, ordered shirt,’ so, the—um, all the box is coming to this person's area, so all she need to do is okay pick one, okay scan, put it in a box, or this shirt is too, scan too.

Most likely they may have a college degree, or no, they may have a high school degree, they may not. So I say one things, like this is like normal for me, but they don't understand, so I have to explain different, different things based on the person I'm talking to. If it’s manager, I can say more technical stuff, but if somebody is saying, ‘This doesn't work,’ so like I have to ask, ‘Would you tell me what, what are you seeing? What did you do?’ I have to ask them one of the time, like ‘Did you press this?‘ ‘Oh no I didn't do it.’ ‘Well, you, you, you missed that one step so that's why it doesn't work.’ So I work with a variety of people um for the problem.\"),\n",

On the other hand, certain area um oh, Texas, Texas has a different personality, they say, ‘I‘m number one, I’m number one,’ like no, you are not number one, your DC, it is small but they say ‘No I'm priority number one.’ No I have other DC they are completely stopped, a hundred people are not working, and so they don't listen.

So I asked them if they are having a same issue like, ‘Come on, I told you like 20 years ago, and you are still having this issue. You supposed to know.’ So like I have this kind of attitude, well I'm just joking to them, but I kind of express you supposed to know by now what to do, instead of calling me. Um, but if it's like higher people I try to hide. And also my difference is when I started work because I don't have uh confidence, um I control my emotion a lot. Right now, I'm higher position, and uh I know I'm the only one person who can solve. So that's why I express my emotions sometimes, especially to the people I know I'm familiar with.\"),\n",

And so they, or they talk too detailed so I'm not frustrated just my eyes are like rolled like what are you talking about, uh that type. And so uh but before I’m frustrated most likely that case because usually that kind of, that time we are talking as a group, so other people already express their frustration before me, so I just sit back and they’re like ‘Okay he's not making sense or he just talking about mumbo jumbo,’ like somebody better stop and uh we look at each other, ‘Who gonna say it,’ that kind.
