Speaker,Dialogue
Interviewer,"So, to start with the interview, do you mind just introducing yourself and telling me a little bit about who you are and a little summary of your education and employment background?"
Participant,"I'm just a note taker so I'm just jotting down all the points, just to make sure I cover the bases."
Interviewer,No that's perfect.
Participant,"yeah, so I am the Vietnamese-American, I was born here in Florida raised here. I received my bachelor's degree in health administration and I also received to my masters in health administration, as well. So that's education, work background, I guess I would count my years working for my parents at their nail salon. That was my official first job for a couple years in undergrad. And then I went on to work at my current university, at the time. Can you still hear? Sorry I thought I froze for a bit there."
Interviewer,Oh no I think you're good.
Participant,"Okay, I went on to work for student government at my university my last year of undergrad. And then, at the beginning of grad school I started working for Brooks Rehabilitation, which is a rehabilitation hospital system here in Jacksonville, in their outpatient setting. So I was there for about eight months, and then I realized it really wasn't a great fit. So I was able to get a job with Baptist Health, which is a nonprofit general hospital organization here in Jacksonville, in the operation side, so still outpatient. So all in all, I would say my healthcare experience totals up to about two years. And actually since I recently graduated, I was looking for a new opportunity that better aligns with my interest so next week, I actually start a new position with McKesson National Healthcare supply chain company, um that really sums up my work experience."
Interviewer,"Well, congratulations, first of all, on your new job. Can you describe a little bit about what role you're going to be playing there."
Participant,"yeah so my job title is associate analyst and from my understanding, I will be managing contracts between McKesson and local healthcare organizations here in Jacksonville. So, what they described is as soon as the sales team seals the deal that's when the customer will get handed off to the team that I'll be joining and we'll be communicating between menu between the manufacturing side and the client side. We’ll be ensuring that your delivery gets fulfilled within the time period that was promised."
Interviewer,"And the delivery, what is it that is being delivered again?"
Participant,Medical supplies.
Interviewer,Medical supplies okay.
Participant,"Yeah or technology. Yeah so that contract ensures that relationship and the hospital will be, you know, they'll call up McKesson and be like hey I actually need like 100,000 vaccine vials because it's flu season and we're giving out vaccines again. So McKesson you know they make the needles that administer the vaccines, they make the little bottles that hold the vaccine, they actually just don't make the medicine itself but it supplies all of the materials, the gauze, everything, the band aids that's required to administer the vaccine to patients—stuff like that."
Interviewer,"Right no, that makes sense. About how big is McKesson do you know."
Participant,"80,000 employees."
Interviewer,Oh wow it's so it's quite big.
Participant,"yeah, pretty much international."
Interviewer,"What about Baptist health, when you were working there, like how big was it and how many people did you work with on a regular basis?"
Participant,"Company wide, 12,000 people only local to Jacksonville and do you mean like how many people that I work with you mean in the team or department."
Interviewer,Mmm just who you saw on a regular basis.
Participant,"regular basis, I would say about 15 people."
Interviewer,15 people. Were they usually the same people or did you see different people?
Participant,Usually the same.
Interviewer,"gotcha. What about with your new job, do you think you're going to be seeing a lot of the same people or do you think you’re going to be interacting with customers who are different all the time?"
Participant,"I'm not 100% sure, because it is a hybrid role. I'm not 100% sure if we're all going to be in the office on the same day, or if we rotate. Haven't talked about that yet."
Interviewer,"gotcha. Um so, for some of these questions, it's going to be about your experiences, so you'll probably want to reference Baptist Health or your Brooks Rehab experiences because you haven't started at McKesson yet um. But I guess one of my questions is how did you feel about your jobs, did you like them, what did you dislike and if you could rate them on a scale from 1 to 10 What would you give them?"
Participant,"For I'll reference Baptist because I was there for the longest. I was there for a year and a half and most recent, I can recall the most experiences from them. So from a 1 to 10 I would give it, I would say... it's a 6.5, out of 10. It is a very much so a stepping stone role, which is why I decided to search elsewhere, even though I haven't really been in a position for a long. The position that I came from covered a lot of the same material that needed to I needed to excel. Um I actually kind of went from a harder job to an easier job, so I was able to learn very quickly, assimilate into the culture and whatnot much quicker. What I liked about the job was there was a lot of learning opportunity because it was an entry role, you know I did ask a lot of questions, even some that didn't really pertain to the role, but leadership was able to either answer it or connect me to someone that could answer it for me. You know very pretty flexible, I was full time student in full time school at that point, so they were flexible on you know if I really needed to take a mental health day. Or if I needed to leave early or come in late, they were very understanding about that, and I was able to flex my hours. I guess in in hindsight I'm realizing now that I'm talking it out, a lot of my other friends, they work in environments where their bathroom time is docked or their PTO has to be submitted like months in advance, whereas, you know, I could just text my boss like ‘Hey, I'm really not feeling good today mentally.’ You know, my other peers can't do that, so in hindsight, is a lot of flexibility. And I think it really just treated us as adults, really. Dislikes is there was a ceiling. There wasn't really a determined career growth or path and, although they did provide a lot of learning within the team in, the same energy wasn't put for learning about more roles within the system. I worked in a department with four different teams, however, we all affected each other, however, the teams itself were working in silos. So we didn't really have a clear understanding of exactly how we affect each other, we just had you know, ‘Oh, we have that group that hires physicians and we have one patient.’ And then my group comes in and we load up, you know, their patients. So I think the dislike for my job was ceiling and teams working in silos and I think the lack of push for internal development in the system."
Interviewer,gotcha yeah that's very clear um. Can you tell me more about the culture and like overall vibe atmosphere there?
Participant,"So the physical vibe, in terms of the cubicle setup and the carpet, cuz I'm very much so like physical and mental mindset. I was like, ‘This could use more color.’ But the atmosphere in terms of how it affected my work, it was fine, it was definitely quiet. And we all have like a bunch of those cubicles, however, my team, we had a joint cubicle where we could all turn around and see each other, so that was quite nice, it was definitely a more open concept. So atmosphere was fine, I would have liked a more open atmosphere. I think the physical walls created those silos in the team because they physically prevent us from really chatting with each other. But in terms of the culture, because of the silos, I felt like there were a lot of cliques. I don't think it was intentional but, again, there were physical barriers, and there was no real push for you to get out of your team and learn about another team, even though they were only five feet away. Yeah I would just say because of the silos there was just cliques, really, I wouldn't say it was to the point where it was super toxic or anything, but it just you know like once you find your people, that's your people, and it felt a little closed off, a little high-school-y. I would say, like that’s the culture, I mean you have some people who have handful of people who will never say hi to anyone, but most people would be like—you know we're from the South—so ‘Hi, good morning, how are you, how was your weekend?’ Majority of people were like that. But there were there were a handful of people who would just beeline for whatever they're going for, they don't care who or what you are, they’re just go into their destination and they don't care how they get there."
Interviewer,"I think there are those people in many organizations probably. What was your team like? Can you tell me a little bit more about your colleagues that you were working with most regularly? In terms of like what kind of people they were, like what your relationship was like, were you guys friends or would you consider them just strictly colleagues? Yeah."
Participant,"yeah, so I will say the team that I was on had, not constant, but about every 2-3 months someone would leave and we would onboard a new person. So obviously I was there the longest, so I would form a bond with like the second person who was there the longest, just because of the time that we spent together. I will say, I work in a team of six, and I had one right-hand person where I could CC on emails so that I can get like her second opinion. We deal with some VIP clients, so if my workload was a little too much, I would feel comfortable delegating the task to her. You know she had very similar personality me, we had a lot of common things together, like, for example, we're both in the midst of planning a wedding, so we could relate a lot on that, personally, just to you know take a little break from work, we’d just talked about like wedding stuff and all of that. And then the other four, I have a pretty good relationship to them, but I wouldn’t say they were as dependable. We kind of have a joke that there's the left-hand side of the cubicle and the right-hand side. The right-hand side are your go to people in the team, were the ones—I was on the right hand—and we're the ones that get asked the questions, we’re the ones that are dealing a lot with office managers and the operations managers and the regional directors as well. And then the left hand side was known for making more mistakes, some of them simple, some of them not so simple, some of them pretty often. So yeah I mean, overall, we did have some tension build up here and there, we did have some times, where we would all just sit in the conference room just to like hash things out because we don't have like team meetings. We never really had like a team huddle or anything so we would only just be working on the floor and it gets kind of stressful sometimes. So yeah, we did have our hardships, where there was some tension here and there. But I think we were able to professionally work it out. We just literally sat in the conference room for two hours on a Monday morning, it was just like we can't keep working like this. But after those sessions, we became probably the strongest team that I've ever been a part of. Even, we laughed and we joked and the atmosphere just got a lot lighter. We talked with patients every single day, this was a time where the temperature of the patients was very, very high, they were not happy, a lot of intense calls, a lot of intense cases that we needed to figure out, so team-wise, they were some rough times, but we definitely grew and we learned and I left a very strong team. So that would be probably a good summary of the team."
Interviewer,Sure. Would you say that your teammates are your friends or would you just specifically call them colleagues?
Participant,"um I would say colleagues that know a lot about me because I spend 40 hours a week with them. Friend wise for me, a friend is when you actively put effort into seeing them in circumstances that you wouldn't already be together. So we never hung out outside of work, we might have a few parking lot conversations after work here and there, or we would have lunch together at work, but I wouldn't consider them a friend, because I did not actively put in effort to see them outside of work circumstances."
Interviewer,Sure sure. Did you feel like you could talk with your coworkers about anything or did you feel like you had to keep it professional and there were certain things that you shouldn't say?
Participant,"Yeah, so I had a few situations regarding this. It would depend on what was happening because I would really consider the fact that, you know, I'm not a team lead, I'm not here to coach you, I'm here to work with you. So I really was evaluating my place really before I decided on what I wanted to say. My rule of thumb was if I have emailed them or talked to them about something at least twice and they do it again, at this point I realized that it's a habit, not a mistake and that it's not my place to fix it, unless it's actually negatively affecting a patient. But if it's just something like they forgot to check an email or they forgot about a meeting and they missed it. If I've already spoken to them once or twice, I usually give them two chances, I was like if I've already spoken to you about it, that's up to our leadership to handle like, you know, it's not really my place, it's not my responsibility. But overall, I felt really comfortable. If it's like the first time I notice—and I'm saying this because I was the longest standing care coordinator, I was the longest standing person there, so I was able to notice a lot more things and I've been through all of the changes and whatnot—but if it's like their first or second you know time, I would definitely give them like a little heads up like I'll either send them a message on teams, or if it's something really quick, really small I'll just turn around and be like ‘Hey I just wanted to remind you that you need to finish up this task,’ or something. Like I mean we're all human at the end of the day, but I definitely felt comfortable if it's their first or second time, if I've already spoken to them about the same situation twice and it still happens, then I just—I let it go."
Interviewer,What about personal things? Did you ever feel like you could talk with them about your personal life or were there certain lines that you shouldn't cross?
Participant,"um. I think I felt comfortable speaking about my personal life to a certain extent, because I think there's definitely something to learn from people. For example, one of my coworkers, her husband is a car salesman and he works in a used car facility so he's very knowledgeable on all different types of cars because they you know sell a variety of cars. So we had a conversation last week about cars, and you know I still live with my parents and we kind of have a system where we all kind of share cars we just take whichever car is the most convenient to take. So, like I kind of chimed in on that conversation because I felt like I had something to add, but I also felt like I had something to take away as well because she's like she has that connection and her husband tells her all these things. So I feel like if it's something I can add a value or I can extract value from."
Interviewer,"You froze there for a second. Sorry, I think you froze for a little bit."
Participant,"that's okay, can you hear me now?"
Interviewer,"Yes, you said, if it was something that you can extract value from and then you cut off."
Participant,"yeah um so, for example, wedding stuff as well, my coworkers wedding is before mine, so I was able to get a lot of tips and whatnot from her. Obviously, certain coworkers know more about me than others um. But I felt comfortable because, again, I was spending more time with these people than anybody else so."
Interviewer,"Right right, yeah. At work, do you feel like you can just be yourself or did you sometimes feel like you had to act a certain way?"
Participant,"I do have a different persona at work. It's a bit more shielded, just because, one boundaries, two work is work, you know you never know who is listening, or you know, you still have to one, cover your base, but two, protect your safety as well. So, for example, like none of my coworkers like know where I live, they just know like the area of town and whatnot. But I would definitely say there's a more professional [Participant 31] at work in terms of how I look, how I dress, my demeanor, things like that. It's just a little shorter walls built up. I do want to maintain that boundary between you know my personal, professional, and academic life, just a little boundary, yeah."
Interviewer,"How do you feel about expressing emotions, both in general and at work?"
Participant,"Well, I don't have a choice, just because emotion is written all over my face, which is the feedback that I've gotten from friends, family, and peers. Those who really know me, they'll be able to read my face well, but in certain situations, I try to either like look at the bigger picture or be the bigger person. You know, depending on either the consequences or the severity of the situation, I'm very much so um—I guess, I work in healthcare and this might be a little dark, but you know if a situation arises, I always ask  like did this hurt anyone, did anyone die, is anyone in immediate danger, if not, then we can kind of let it go. But I feel more comfortable expressing emotion in my personal life for sure, just because they know me, you know, I don't really have any major consequences with them. In terms of work, I more so assess the situation and I think you know what value do I add if I say what I want to say this way versus the other way. What's the most productive, you know what works best for the team, really. I feel like at work, I really think about like what value will that add because there's just so much going on in a hospital system like this is just one small thing like is it really worth sulking over or fighting over something like that, but. Again, definitely at work there's more consideration into expressing emotion."
Interviewer,You seem like a very thoughtful person who like really thinks about these things before acting.
Participant,"Yeah I try, I'm really working on it.t actually took a lot to get to where I am today, through you know tough lessons, mistakes, and all of that, because I grew up in a household where we just buried everything. And you know, like especially my family, we don't really believe mental health, so I started going to therapy, I started learning how to regulate emotions or just really thinking before saying, whereas, growing up, even into college, it was always I don't care what you think, I'm going to say when I went to say and that definitely did not work out, especially in corporate. So yeah, I'm working on it, thank you."
Interviewer,"When you say it didn't work out, what sort of things happened in corporate?"
Participant,"um I definitely didn't think about the weight of my words. So it affected some people and I got pulled aside to be like ‘Hey so and so,’ or like sometimes the person who pulled me over directly and they're like ‘Oh, I heard you know so and so and that doesn't make me feel good,’ and I was like ‘Oh my God I'm sorry that wasn't my intention, I just didn't think before I said anything.’ Just getting feedback from people um and just like realizing like thinking like ‘Oh, if someone said that to me how would I feel?’ Or like what type of environment am I creating for the team versus what type of environment do I thive in and am I providing that for the team? So yeah."
Interviewer,"Sure, sure."
Participant,Lots of learning opportunities there.
Interviewer,yeah. Do you ever vent or complain to your colleagues or listen to them vent or complain to you?
Participant,"Yes to both. Yeah. Yeah we usually try to do it either off the clock, or you know physically, those are like the parking lot conversations. And again, we also deal with patients all day, every day, so it does get a little mentally taxing. So when it comes to like venting and complaining about patients, we’ll just turn around in our cubicle and will be like ‘Guys, you can't believe what type of patient I just got.’ But in terms of each other, yeah that does happen—it doesn't happen as much anymore, but yeah we do."
Interviewer,"um, can you tell me more about the demographics of the people you work with, like what kind of gender, race, and age are they, is it pretty diverse, that kind of thing?"
Participant,"Age wise is pretty diverse. We have anywhere from recent college grad to you-should-be-retired. And then race, I would say, definitely predominantly white, I would say 80% white, maybe 15%. Black/African American, and I'd say maybe like—I don't know if we had any Hispanic—and then the remaining 5% everyone else, just because they're so little of us. I think out of the 45-ish people we had in the department, I was one of three Asians. So small, small percentage. Gender, definitely more female because I work in hospital administration, so I'd say about 90-95% female actually."
Interviewer,Oh wow
Participant,"We only have a handful of men, just a few, few handful."
Interviewer,"yeah, what about on your specific team?"
Participant,"Out of the six people on the team, one was male—so gender, very small percentage. Race, it was 50% black, one person or 16% white we had one white person, and then one European, and then I was the only Asian."
Interviewer,gotcha gotcha. Um did you ever feel like your race mattered or impacted how you review that were?
Participant,"Absolutely just because I live in a small—not a small city, we have like a million people— but I live in a city with a fairly small Asian population. Just about 5% of the population is Asian. And, in the end, that was definitely reflected in work as well, just because it was the same thing, almost everyone was pretty much white, to be transparent. I definitely think it mattered because I constantly saw, essentially, white people get paid more, get more advantages, get moved up quicker, so I definitely felt that being Asian I had to always have my best foot forward and I definitely felt that I needed to put in more effort to get, hopefully, the same opportunities as others. And the reason why I know all of this is I actually had a lot of members of my grad school cohort work in different departments as well. And we had a very close bond, we were very transparent to each other, so we talked about salary, we talked about work model, we talked about like flexibility. And again, it really boils down to your leadership, but again my cohort themselves, they were mostly white, so they were getting promotion on promotion, or they were getting considered for, you know, higher level jobs. So I definitely think that it matters. At work, my system was pretty conservative—Baptist—so definitely felt like I had to put a lot more effort to get noticed as well."
Interviewer,"Sure, sure sure. How did you feel about your other colleagues who were not white, like did they feel the same way, or would you have placed them in the same you know category as white colleagues, in terms of like getting moved up or having higher pay?"
Participant,"It was weird. I actually grabbed lunch with a former colleague of mine, just yesterday, and he is black and it's very 50/50 for the black community at the hospital I worked with. Um some were treated on the same level as, you know, the White peers, while some others got treated just like how I felt. I'm not sure if it was based on performance, I'm not sure if it was based on any personal relationships, but, from what I noticed, it wasn't really consistency definitely along the black population, but there were definitely a few individuals that resonated with me or that I resonated with. And there were a few that were just killing it, so it's really hard to tell. Our system was also pretty big, and again I wasn't there for too, too long, but that’s pretty much my takeaway."
Interviewer,"Sure, yeah. Did you ever experience like racial comments or any kind of stereotyping network?"
Participant,"No, I didn't. I mean, luckily, the department I worked with, pretty open minded. But yeah no. Very lucky not to have experienced that yet."
Interviewer,"Good. Yeah sure, um, can you think of any times when you felt particularly emotional at work?"
Participant,"yeah it wasn't due to work, though um it just happened during work. But it was a day where the wedding venue called and they were like, it was basically some issues and they we're like ‘Oh, we actually have to cancel your contract, we can't take you on anymore.’ And I remember like the floor was spinning around me, so I was just like ‘What am I going to do now, I literally don't have a wedding venue?’ And that call was on top of a bunch of other things that had happened that really like was already frustrating me, with like family stuff and whatnot, so I was already kind of on edge. But that call really like ‘ugh another thing that I have to worry about.’ So obviously I started to like cry—and I was also full-time student, so my days were like 14 hours long—I just started crying and I just like ‘Oh I just don't really like how I feel right now.’ And so I realized the mental state I was in and I needed to get outside and just take like a 10-15 minute breather. So I walked back into the cubicle and, like the team saw that my eyes were red and they're like ‘Oh what's wrong, what's wrong?’ And I was just like dabbing my tears, I was like guys like it's not work, it's just everything else outside of work that's really just making me feel like I have so much on my plate. And they were all like super supportive. I was like ‘Sorry like I just can't with work right now, like I can't like deal with patients.’ They we're all super supportive at the end of the day, but yeah I think that would probably be the most emotional time, when I was just straight up crying in front of my coworkers and I felt okay to do so, just because transparency is probably the best thing to do, luckily we were still masking, so it wasn't bad."
Interviewer,"Sure, sure. What about your other colleagues, did you ever see any of them like cry at work or get really emotional?"
Participant,"yeah um. Definitely another one did, she had another situation with her family, where she got a call in middle of the day and yeah she was crying and she was just telling us. Basically, like her sister got Baker Act-ed and she has kids that my coworker had to handle and whatnot, and it was just a lot. And she got very emotional and she was crying and we pretty much responded the same way as my situation from earlier. We told her like, ‘Dude, go home. Like take care of the kids, take care of yourself. Do whatever you need to do.’ She's like ‘No, no it's fine, I'm just going to like hang out here, my husband's grabbing all the kids but like I'm just going to be probably in and out on phone calls or something with the county and whatnot.’ But yeah there were some tears, but it was never doodle work, it was just more so personal stuff."
Interviewer,"Right. Sure, sure. Has anything been different, because of the pandemic with your work setup or like the dynamics that were?"
Participant,"No, we only thing different was just the masking."
Interviewer,Sure.
Participant,"And because of the pandemic, I think, like the other patients a lot angrier. Because our restrictions got even more tight with everything, but it didn't affect the physical aspect of work or anything."
Interviewer,"In the last couple of months or last couple of years, there's been an increase in news reports about violence against Asian Americans. Is that something that you've been aware of, and is it something that has affected you at all?"
Participant,"It hasn’t personally affected me in any way as in I don't know anyone that has experienced that, but I have been a lot more cautious. Just because I do live, you know, in Florida—I don't know if you heard all about our craziness but."
Interviewer,"I'm actually from Florida so I know all about it, yeah."
Participant,"yeah yeah what city, if you don't mind me asking?"
Interviewer,"I'm from Parkland, Florida."
Participant,"Oh okay so South Florida. Yeah, so it just has made me more cautious. I'm already pretty much an over thinker, I'm always thinking, ‘What is the worst case possible that can happen?’ Definitely more conscious, I'm doing a lot more 360 turns when I'm out and about. I don't go anywhere alone when it gets dark. I stick to areas where I know have lower crime rates, even if that means I have to drive a little farther. But yes that's the only way it's really affected me. Luckily, I haven't had any instances happen, but I know people, my peers, my friends, that have had comments made to them or, you know, I'm personally still masking, but most of the people are in so I've heard my friends get comments on their masks in public. But that's about the only thing I really hear."
Interviewer,"Sure. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about today that you would want to discuss? It could be about your workplace, it could be about any of the topics that we touched on."
Participant,"I think we covered it a lot. I will say one thing that I learned about working in corporate in the past two years is—you know how we always talk about culture of organization and all of that—I definitely think, in my opinion, I think, culture is cultivated by the manager of the department, so one thing that I've learned that no one ever really told me about either in school or through my mentors, no one ever really mentioned that to me. So I think it's definitely something that you know early grads or just early careerists should know."
Interviewer,Sure. What was your manager like?
Participant,"My manager, so I had like three levels of direct reports: I had a supervisor, I had a manager, and I had a director. And the director is the big dog, she makes all of the decisions that just trickles down the chain um. One of the big reasons I left is I did not thrive under my director's leadership. Um, she is very experienced but I just I just didn't thrive, in my opinion, she was definitely a white older woman who didn't really understand how to build a diverse team, or just didn't understand you know the advantages of having a diverse team. So that's one of the main reasons why I left, and it was just mainly she was also very just out of touch again, even our directories worked in a silo. We never saw her even though we share the same office suite, but I just never saw her, she would just be in and out, so it's just very disconnected."
Interviewer,gotcha. Do you have any examples of why you felt that way about your director?
Participant,"um I guess through our very limited interactions, she did mistake me for another Asian. But it's weird because the other Asian left a year prior and when she did that—this was actually just like two or three months ago, so I had already been in the suite for well over a year. And her and I, we pretty much share the same hair, but that's about it. She's Filipino, so she's much darker, she’s a lot shorter—just we don't really look alike, but she's still like mistook us. And also just in the way that—I knew, she was out of touch just because I just grabbed that from the meetings that we were having with her on how to change our workflows, or just talking about work. Like she would always ask ‘Well, what is this, what is that?’ Meanwhile she's been director of this team since conception, which was eight years ago. And I feel like she just didn't really grasp just the basic concepts of what we did, and how we did it, even though she's making very major decisions that affect what we do. And I was like, ‘Dang if she doesn't understand what this is, and she's been director for eight years, do you really know what we do then?’"
Interviewer,Right
Participant,"and you can't make decisions for a team you don't know the workflow of. That’s kind of just kind of yellow flag in my head, like I feel like it's something that a director should know, considering she's been director of the team for almost 10 years. Um but yeah just there were there were some moments where it was like, ‘Oh she's actually a great leader, very articulate, just always knew the right thing to say.’ But in terms of personal interactions and whatnot, I just I just didn't think I thrived under her leadership."
Interviewer,"What about with your manager and your supervisor, how are they?"
Participant,"Yeah, so my manager was amazing. She really pretty much moved mountains for the team. Chain management is quite slow at our system, but she was able to get things done, and she was quick at it. And she always followed through. As far as my supervisor, not as quick, but she still looked out for the team, and she kept us updated, pretty transparent most of the time. But definitely, since they dealt with us a little more, I'm definitely more comfortable with them than our director."
Interviewer,"Sure. When you say that the culture is cultivated by the managers, like what do you mean exactly by that and are you talking about these kinds of things, or something else?"
Participant,"pretty much referencing what I just said. Like, even though I left the organization, I will always reconsider rejoining just a different department. You know, going back to my classmates being in other departments and hearing their experience, like there are great departments within Baptist and there are ones where we have diverse leadership. I was actually able to meet some other leaders through like the employee resource group meetings and socials and whatnot. And their leaders were just so much more approachable. And you know it was just definitely maybe a personality thing, and you know we were always taught that like you don't have to like your coworker as a person, but like you have to you know deal with them as a coworker. But just their approach to things. For example, I'll give you a more clear picture. In my team you weren't allowed to join these ERGs until you hit a year because they wanted you to focus your time on the work that we had to do, because we were constantly on the phone with patients. I would say definitely kind of like a very glamorized call center. We basically did what a call center did but, again, we were very flexible, all that. So my supervisor was like, ‘Oh well, I will only allow you 30 minutes per month to do like an extracurricular outside of whatever you do for your work.’ And I was like ‘30 minutes is nothing, it takes me like five minutes to get to the parking lot, it takes me five minutes to get to the event, and then like my time is already like 30% gone.’ So I was like I'm not gonna bother. And meanwhile—so I couldn't join the the ERGs until a year in and they meet for like an hour or two every month, so they don't even meet that often—but meanwhile, my friends, my classmates who got a job at Baptist um, they were on an ERG meeting their second day of work. Because I saw them, I was like ‘Oh my God like you're already here, like you're on you're on a roll.’ And they were like ‘Yeah our manager actually is making us go to this, so we can meet new people and learn about the system.’"
Interviewer,I see.
Participant,"You know what I mean, it's like my manager or my supervisor was like no, you have to wait a year, whereas, my friends, two of them, started in a different department, they were on an ERG just meeting everyone and learning about the system on day two."
Interviewer,sure.
Participant,"yeah so and again, same system. Even like our department works directly with each other, but yeah so that's kind of like a probably clear picture on what I mean by it's really being in the right place, right time, with the right people."
Interviewer,"Right, right, right. No that makes sense. Well that's about it for my questions. I have a couple of demographic questions that I think we've covered most of. Let's see you're located in Jacksonville, can you tell me again where you were born and grew up."
Participant,Jacksonville as well.
Interviewer,"Also Jacksonville okay. Um and your ethnic background is Vietnamese, you said."
Participant,Yes.
Interviewer,"Okay, and were your parents born in Vietnam, or were they born in the US?"
Participant,Vietnam.
Interviewer,okay gotcha so you would consider yourself like second generation or...
Participant,I think I'm first gen—because first gen means you're the first generation to be born in foreign land.
Interviewer,oh okay
Participant,let's Google this because I don't want to give you the wrong information. Yeah well according to... it says yeah first generation refers to those who are foreign born.
Interviewer,"Okay, so your parents would be first generation?"
Participant,"No, my parents were born in—well actually I'm confused."
Interviewer,"Okay, it would be the ones who are foreign born, maybe yes. I don't know okay gotcha. yeah it doesn't matter I was just verifying."
Interviewer,"um, can you tell me your age real quick?"
Participant,yeah 23
Interviewer,23. And your gender pronouns?
Participant,She her.
Interviewer,"gotcha all right yeah I think we covered everything else oh yeah so that's it, let me go ahead and stop this recording real quick."
