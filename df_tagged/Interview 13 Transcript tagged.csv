Unknown,Participant 13
Interviewer,"um so my first question is just do you mind introducing yourself and telling me a little bit about who you are, where you're from, and a little bit of your education and employment history."
Participant,"Yes, I was born in Taiwan, my name is [name], born in Taiwan and my father moved all his five kids here uh in the late 1980s. So, I went to Western Oregon University for undergrad and Oregon State University for a master's degree in psychology, statistics, and women’s studies. And my PhD, also from Oregon state, was human development and family science, so—and minor in psychology. And uh my employment history, when I was a student, I I worked at the library um at the university and I TA’d for Mandarin Chinese and uh. And then, when I was a graduate student and then I was a teaching assistant and I taught classes, and then before this job at University of Central Missouri which started in 1997, I was like part time at Washington State University and Oregon State University. So, yeah, I've been at UCM since 1997, and [name] was the search committee chair who hired me. So..."
Interviewer,"Oh, well that's good to know."
Participant,"he's responsible for everything yeah, just kidding. Just kidding."
Interviewer,"um, can you tell me a little bit more about your current role and um about the university setting where you work."
Participant,"Okay, so my current role, I am a professor of child and family development. We’re housed in the school of—it's kind of interesting we’re in college of business. But we are in the professional school, well you know, like we moved to college of business really because there was some kind of administrative—some kind of, I think it’s like a screw up. But we're happy at college of business and they have more money, so we've been treated well—I mean equally. And uh um yeah, well okay, I'm in charge of our college’s online teaching, so I have some relief time, in addition to my regular faculty position."
Interviewer,got it. Yeah.
Participant,yeah. Oh let me tell you a little bit more...
Interviewer,um can you tell me a little more... oh sorry.
Participant,"Yeah, but let me tell you I just thought about, you know, because this is a study about work right, I need to tell you a little bit about where I was. So I was faculty and I was program coordinator, or like a department chair—okay well, our program was small, so it was really not a department yet, so a program coordinator, so we have some administrative position. And then I, you know, like have different positions, such as like the faculty center president, the president of the college assembly, and for our professional organization, I was serving on the um board for a couple years. And then like various leadership positions and I was also elected as the interim principal for the Chinese School of Greater Kansas City. Um, like you know, that's like a one year—actually, I was the president of the board first and then later on like a consultant. It’s all voluntary work. And then become the interim principle because of, you know, there was a crisis. So, I think that this will give you a better understanding about where I have been at work. I've been pretty much in academia and also have some school connections with the local community and professional organizations that I'm a member and also have been elected for different leadership positions, and I also did international research. Well more with uh Sweden, I only been there twice, um so like a research grant you know, took me to Sweden and the research was about sexuality education. And I have done like a guest lecture in Japan, Taiwan, and Canada and then did research with faculty from Mexico as well. So, I think that's pretty good, you should have a good understanding."
Interviewer,"yeah, no, it sounds like you've done a lot, that's really great. I am interested in a lot of your work experiences, but for this I guess you could focus on mostly just the one that you're in right now. And uh can you tell me a little bit more about your department and your co workers, like how big is your department, how many people are you working with on a regular basis, and what is kind of that dynamic?"
Participant,"Okay, so our department is actually in a transition right now, we were at a school of human services, and we are child and family development program, but because of whatever budgetary issue or maybe a new provost did decided to do something new, right now, nobody at schools, we are all departments. So we are department of human services, and we're still a program. So I think that the funny thing, interesting thing about us is that we have always have our program autonomy, our program is child and family development and right now, we have nine full time faculty and all nine of us have terminal degree like, you know, like PhD. However, a couple are online only so we don't really see them. And then our program actually have undergraduate degree, and we also have masters in marriage and family therapy, so we have a few clinical faculty and we also have a clinic. Like on site clinic. So I don't really go for summer I don't go, I think I go like a once a month in the summer, or as needed. But regular semester, like a pre-COVID or after COVID, right after vaccination, I'm usually on campus. Because we also have two campus, you know. I'm usually on campus to have 2-3 times a week and then, who do I see depends on who are usually there, about two or three faculty. We have similar work schedules, so I see them on a very frequent basis, and right now I am the most senior faculty in my program because [name] left. So, and actually I hired well, I was the search chair to hire one that right now working. So, we have a small—we only have nine faculty and we have about 160 students and our graduate program is thriving. Yeah uh anything else I need to..."
Interviewer,"No that's great, uh can you tell me about the demographic backgrounds of your like department faculty, like uh age, gender, race? That kind of thing."
Participant,"Okay, so we, we okay—we try to, you know, we try to be very—like diversity and inclusion is very important when we are hiring people. So, around the 9 people that, you know, because I was chair of everyone. Okay, of course you know, we want to get the person of the subject area expertise, but we also have diversity inclusion in mind. Okay, so you have me, I'm Asian I am 56 but look 29. Okay, I'm just trying to think about in the office. Okay, then we have another, [name], she's probably in her mid-30s, she's Caucasian—she looks Caucasian to me, but you know I never asked her what. She looks Caucasian to me, I think she's from Kansas, I think she's Caucasian. Like she graduated from Kansas state, do you need her—like what demographic are you thinking age, race."
Interviewer,"yeah just age, race, gender is fine."
Participant,"Okay, all right, she is a she. And then we have [name]. [Name] is probably in her 30s as well, she's getting married in like two days, I think she identify with African American. Yeah, I think yeah she yeah she identify with African American. She's MFT. And then we have [name], who is probably in his late 40 or mid 40s, and Caucasian man. And we have [name] he is probably about 50 years old. He was born in I want to say Albania, so he is like Southern Europe but the funny thing is that he plays soccer, so all the years our students thought that he was probably Latino because he is so tan with dark hair. But I know that he's Eastern European. Okay so that's 5, okay, then we have [name], she was born in Iran. And she is probably her 40s, she's kind of newer faculty, but she didn't get her PhD until much—well you know, like she wasn't traditional, she didn't get her PhD right way, so she that's her. And then we [name], [name] is  probably early 30s or mid 30s. He just got his PhD, I mean he just defended it, like last month. He's finishing up like the submission, so he's like almost doctor. He is Caucasian. Well I—he looks Caucasian to me, I think he identifies with White. Okay, and then we have [name], she is biracial, and she's biracial of white and black. She identify as Black—not African American, because she says she doesn't know who's African American. She identifies with black, okay. So okay, and we have [name] she identify as a she and uh Nlack. So, that's 9 of us."
Interviewer,"yeah, no that seems like a very diverse group actually."
Participant,"Yeah. Because when we are hiring, we are very thoughtful about—and sometimes you offer, but they may not come. It's not like lack of trying, so we yeah, we really try."
Interviewer,"Um in the past, when you were younger, more junior faculty, was it like that, as well?"
Participant,"Oh no, in 1997, in [name]’s department, I... yeah, I was the only non-White faculty."
Interviewer,"And, was it mostly men, as well?"
Participant,"um, let me think. I think it's about, okay we have, yeah about half and half. Two women, three men."
Interviewer,got it yeah.
Participant,"yeah, but I do want to say maybe because of our field, okay. Like I say that in a positive way that, you know, like my colleagues—although they are white men—but they are like honorary minority women. Like, you know [name], you know like, he is um if... there is any equity or issue, inclusion, like he will be the one who notice first before me. So yeah, so I think that I'm very fortunate at the time that, although I was the only um minority woman at the time, I feel very I feel very supported, I have to say, I feel very supported. Within our program, within our program. And that's actually why I decided to come to UCM, because at the time I had other positions offered, and it’s really largely because of [name]. Really, largely because of [name], because you know I went to school in the State of Oregon, and then you know, coming to the Midwest I was a little bit reluctant.  I have always wanted to go to a teaching-focused university, which is UCM. And I wanted to be like somewhere that, you know, is kind of closer to the big city, but not in the big city. So UCM really was perfect and the only hesitation was, you know, would I feel comfortable there? And because really, you know, you’re environment is constructed by the people you work with, immediately. So yeah it was [name] and [name], they are retired, but I continue to have contact with actually [name]. He just came to my daughter's graduation party. And then [name], [name] is a like hippy, long hair, mustache, never wears socks, actually like Steve had a lot to do... I think [name] and [name] made me feel that if UCM can have like a kind person like [name], and then have a very wild horse like [name], it's probably okay [laugh]. Yeah, so yeah, so I was the only..."
Interviewer,"So, do you feel, like, in that environment like you can be yourself at work—"
Participant,Yes.
Interviewer,—or you feel like you have to act a certain way?
Participant,"No, actually I refer to when I had the five of us. We have [name] and [name], you know, that was my golden year, because my program was so supportive because I had a young baby at the time. They were so supportive, they would come to my house for department meetings, for program meetings."
Interviewer,"Oh wow, wow..."
Participant,"Yeah, yeah and I just need to do microwave popcorn. So they are so supportive. And then, in fact, that [name], you know [name], [name] actually watched my daughter sometimes."
Interviewer,Oh [name].
Participant,"oh yes, yeah and I remember [name], when I first met [name], he has some kind of gigantic cockroach for science experiment, or something. Anyhow, and he was showing me he was a child right. I was like, ‘Oh.’ I think he was like 14 or something and I think [name] was like tiny at the time, well, maybe like 7 or 8. I mean well, you know, because I'm short, I remember [name] was shorter than me so... yeah, at the time. How tall is [name] now?"
Interviewer,"Um not tall, he's maybe 5’8”."
Participant,"Oh well that’s, I’m barely 5’, I’m only 4’11” yeah."
Interviewer,"I’m only, I’m 5’2” so yeah."
Participant,"Okay, so at the time, I do not feel that at all. Maybe, it was naïve, maybe it was because I was very protected by the by the good people I work with at the time. But I do feel—I feel my gender and my race later on, and a bigger context. So..."
Interviewer,Can you tell me about that?
Participant,"Yes, so I feel my race. And my gender, for example, you know that English is not my first language, and also because of culture, that I may not be as forceful. I'm probably very polite. If somebody does something wrong, I will probably say, ‘Hey I heard this, and this, you might want to check with that.’ I won't come up with, like, ‘That's wrong.’ you know, not as direct. So that, um and I have found that some people will respect you no matter what. But sometimes, you know gender and race, they intersect, and there were times I feel that I wasn't heard. Or that I was, ‘I just said that. And you didn't hear me, but now, a White man say it and then everybody heard and say ‘That's a good idea,’ like are you crazy?’ So I think that was then, but then there were times like that, but now because I—and then also that when I just started my career in 1997, I was like 29 I was young. And I look young at the time as well. So sometimes, for example, I went to a meeting, and then the other faculty would say, ‘This is for faculty.’ or, ‘This is faculty parking.’ But I think those are kind of funny. Yeah, because when I think that when people do not know you, you know people process your appearance right, and we know age, sex, gender, those are very salient factors people look at. Okay so that's that."
Participant,"And I have, for example, you know I was at an office and asking some questions. The thing is, I don't think the receptionist know the detail. Okay, for example, I'm a professor, there are three different assessment I'm looking for. Okay, so I want assessment number two. But she didn't know there are three, she only knew one, so I heard her like you know call someone say, ‘Hey you know, I have a woman here, she doesn't know what she wants, can you come out to help?’ And I had to stop her and say, ‘Excuse me, I do know what I want, there are three different types of assessment. I would like to assess them on number two and, by the way, I'm a faculty, I'm a professor.’ But as you meet more of the people who don't know you, um maybe people have less training or sensitivity to be polite, you know. Sometimes people just make assumptions, you know um and uh... yeah. And uh really, she didn't know, like I wasn't confused, like she was the one who didn't know. But, like things like this, a lot of times like I'm not sure, is it just because of her ignorance, or is this my gender and my race have anything to do? Okay so like there are things like this and also, for example you know, if I am alone with my daughter, like we went to different places, people cut in line. Sometimes I would say, ‘Excuse me,’ and they say, ‘Sorry, I didn't see you.’ Or they look at me and they just ignore me. I just can't believe that. It's like airport, you know, and like usually White guy do this."
Participant,"Well, anyhow, but then it's like... okay I'm short and I don't know Kung Fu. To what extent do I want to fight this fight, and when I have a child with me. You know, and so sometimes I wish that if I'm not with my child, and this is a public place, I would probably do like some raising my voice. Like, ‘Hey, excuse me,’ you know, because we know I'm going to say, ‘Excuse me, you probably didn't know that I was here first. Could you go back, the line is here.’ But then, when people like look at me, and then just like continue, and I have a child and sometimes I just don't know. This could be a psycho. And you know, do I want to risk our safety? And then a lot of times in those kind of places, I just don't do anything because I just don't know who that person is. What that person could have done. So those kind of thing. Yeah, but then I will file, I would let the flight attendant know or someone know. But they usually can’t do anything, they can do anything so."
Interviewer,"Right, right, yeah, yeah um. What about with students, have you had any like racial comments or stereotyping that you've perceived from students that you teach?"
Participant,"Okay, so when I was an undergraduate student, you know when you when you do not speak very good English, that language and people can always blame you for whatever things. Right, you know, so I have some of this and I think that the communication um is very important and then how communication is not just the speaking perfect English. Because, as we all know, people can speak perfect English but you just don't get along or you don't understand the person anyhow. So I think that in my teaching, because I know that English is not my first language, so I'm very cognizant. I make sure I have a visual aid and then if they have questions, I would like to think that my students are comfortable, they will let me know. And then, here's something else, okay here is race, gender and then, I have a class called sexuality, which is taboo. So there's all kinds of different things right. You know, for example, I have students complain about you know, ‘Dr. [Name] is talking about sex in class.’ And then at the time, our department chair was uh very supportive and then he said, ‘We pay Dr. [name] to talk about sex, I hope she's talking about sex in class.’ Right, okay and then I think that, because it was an American family class and then we have students say, ‘How can you have a foreigner teaching American family?’ yeah, you know, ‘She's not even from here.’ And—again depends on who the department, who’s in support—and at the time that department chairs say, ‘You know, that's her expertise. Okay, all right, is every parent an expert in parenting? Just because you have experience doesn't mean that that, you know, you are the expert for that.’ And also, you know, I think a lot of people just confuse experience and expertise."
Participant,"Okay, but I do want to tell you, after COVID, like with all the hatred of like China virus, you know, like all the previous president, yeah that person, have done to damage you know the Asian American, that I found students wrote irrelevant comments in my evaluation. Like irrelevant  because when I went to class, I usually double mask and I and I have a microphone so I want to make sure students can hear me. But you know, and then we require students to wear a mask right. So remember, this is a teaching evaluation, it’s about the class. And then I have student, you know went on a tangent about, ‘Why do you require us to wear masks?” you know, like, ‘I don't want to wear a mask.’ Those kind of thing, and I think it's kind of ridiculous. And I have other faculty, not me, but I have other Asian faculty say that you know they experience, like the lowest teaching evaluation, you know, like in the midst of COVID."
Participant,"And it’s things like this, like you don't know right, is this like related? And we all know, does it become very subtle, um it's not very overt. But okay, I actually have a daughter called [name] like she is 24. So she’s back in school. She actually lives in Boston right now, and when she was in California, she actually experienced... Like you know, she was just at a Costco gas station getting gas. And then she—you know, this coward drove by, throw water bottle at her and then asked her to go back to her country. And she was born here. We have never been to China, you know, but it doesn't matter right, you know. It doesn't matter even if we are from China, nobody should be treated this way. So I know that she has experienced that, actually that was one of the reasons she feel she wanted to move out of California. And then you would think that California would have a lot of Asian, probably better, I don’t know. So yeah, that's her experience. And I know my sister—I think at work is more subtle, when people know you—but it's really when strangers or people do not know you. And I know that you know, like really COVID time, my sister she works at another local university and she said she was in the parking lot. She was just at the parking lot looking at her cell phone and her husband—who is Mexican American but looks Caucasian like a White... yeah so—so like her husband was inside Costco, actually Costo again, um doing some shopping. They just needed a few things, so she was in the car. So she said, like suddenly like somebody like shook the car and then like yelled something, but she couldn't hear it. But is this like related or not, you just kind of don't know. Yeah then she just say that she just called her husband, say, ‘You know, honey, you need to come back here,’ you know. And then by the time her husband came back, you know, that person that already left, but you never know, you know, things like this. And I have heard one of my colleagues, this is not my immediate colleague, this is like in the same college. The person who said this was a White man. And at the time we had another faculty, a Korean American faculty, and then I think her voice is kind of higher pitch. You know some women have a more of, you know, like we just have different voice. Okay, we just have a different voice okay, all right. So she was teaching and I think we were in a committee. We walked by, and I was the only woman, only non-White. And then I think he forgot, and he was just looking at the other guy, and he say, like, ‘Sounds like a yellow whore on TV.’ and I was like...."
Interviewer,Like what?
Participant,"Yellow whore. And then I don't know what is the reference and then he's like, ‘Oh yeah, there was like a TV,’ he was just trying to explain it. In whatever—he was explaining like I think that he realized, like he say that and then I was like what, and then he said, ‘Oh no no no it’s uh uh uh...’ Like a he said that in, I don't know 50s or 60s, there was a TV show and then the Asian woman was always—like a dragon lady—were always shouting or mean. And then the colleagues teaching, they remind him of that yellow whore. But it's still inappropriate."
Interviewer,yeah.
Participant,"So... but I did tell our dean, so. And I don't know whether somebody talked to him or not. I do not know. Because I think a lot of time when things like this happen, I do not have a good, like a witty come back right away. I will be more like in shock like when somebody says something will be like, ‘What!?’ And then there are other conversation, right, but then I'm like still dealing with that. And then I usually... it depends on what people, if the person, I'm comfortable with that probably didn't mean, you know, the kind of intention. Like in my mind, perceiving intention is important as well. I will talk to that person say, ‘Hey,’ actually, I talked to one of my colleague because he said something like, ‘Of course that in all the top students are Asian, anyhow, like you guys have smarter,’ you know, ‘We're all dumb.’ Even things like this, and I know that he was like joking, okay. Yeah but I know he was joking, but I still have to say something like, ‘Well I know you're joking right, say you're joking, and we all know that you know...’ that there are some culture differences. Like you know that a lot of Asian American family value academics and also they're putting a lot, a lot, a lot of hard work and nobody play in sports. You know like because he spends so much time and money in soccer. It is an incredible about amount of the time and then yeah for soccer so. Yeah so kind of depends on the re—I think that, you know, when I'm older now—that depends on the relationship I had, I feel comfortable talking to someone. But if I perceive I may be in danger or, you know, that by talking to that person directly is not going to go anywhere, I'll report to someone. But it’s still in a very nice way. You know I still never accuse anyone, I describe the fact, this is what I heard and that's my interpretation, and I'm not comfortable because of this. I just thought you might want to know. And then sometimes they will say, you know, a similar complaint has been made. And then, add to the book, so."
Interviewer,"Sure, sure. Has there ever been a time when you felt like extremely emotional, maybe during one of these kind of incidents or in some other context? And this could be any kind of emotion too—it could be anger, but it could also be, like, sadness or nervousness or."
Participant,"Um there was one time that I cried because I feel misunderstood. But I think that's maybe that, you know, because I was teaching sexuality, right, and then in our textbook we have to cover a wide spectrum of sexual behavior right, you know. Yeah, many type of sexual behavior. And uh this student, you know, some people belong to certain religious like denomination that anyone mention about sex are devils—anyhow, I think she belonged to one of that. So she actually accused me of—I can’t remember what—what she did was she filed complaints for—I don’t remember what. Like it was like untrue, you know um, she accused me of um oh yeah. I think that you know, for example, hooking up is a very common phenomenon among college students. And our textbook talked about this, I talked about this. Our textbook talk about different types of sexual behavior, I talk about this. And she felt those are vulgar and uh then she actually sent an email to—not just my department chair—but our dean, and she just make a big deal, but I think it was really more of her own political agenda. And that was a time I feel like very, very—um, uh I feel like hurt and misunderstood. Yet luckily, my colleagues backed me up. They know—but this is common, right, anyone that teach sexuality, you know kind of Bible belt. We kinda see that's coming. And that is actually why they have me teaching sexuality, because I'm full professor, I'm tenured, I have been married for 32 years. I am probably the “safest” demographic."
Participant,"So that that's actually why, because we know. We actually have sex therapist on staff, but like he's younger. Our student look at him like this already [enamored look] and he is a—he cannot teach the sexuality class because, you know, because he's not tenure, he just cannot risk his career for any potential thing, so. So that was the one time, I feel very, very, very misunderstood, really misunderstood. But I have great colleagues. I think our field probably doesn't make a lot of money, but we have great people. I mean people are in this feel that, you know, are not here for money, are trying to make a difference and do the right things. And I have to credit myself for hiring great people, those very nice and compassionate people."
Participant,"And then I think about anytime... Oh, and one time, when I was interim principle for Chinese school. They are actually Asian guys, two Asian guys have maybe a problem with women being leadership position. So they were just being difficult. Like, for example, I was principal. I told the secretary, who was a man, being very clear about our school website needed to update, need to do this, and this. And he complains about ‘I don't have time’ and I say, ‘Well, this is really important,’ so you know he was just like discounting um like the things I asked him to do, which is within his job description. And finally I had to—I actually hired a different one. I give him some opportunity, but really like when you're in when you're in a higher position that you go ‘Hey, you know what, I noticed that you know you're very busy duh duh duh duh...’ I don't care, right, ‘Um yeah so is this too much for you. Yeah is it too much for you?’ And then he's like, well because like Chinese school is like, you know, a weekend job. So he said, ‘Oh, you know what, well thank you for letting me know, you know, I'm going to...’ Because I have someone already, in line already, but I'm going to I'm going to find a replacement for you, so I don't want you to be that stressed, so I actually switched him and he was happy, and I was happy because I have someone, they were very competent and positive attitude. And then the treasurer, at the time, he filled the important position of principle in order to secure funding. So I guess, was giving me a hard time because I haven't showed that I can get funding. So, I guess, I think that you cannot go in and expect to be respected. You kind of have to earn, right, wherever you go. So I think to that person—because to some other teaching staff, I brought in, you know, my teaching experience, tools to enhance learning/teaching—and those were not a problem. But then if someone expect that, you know, you to bring in money and I'm not trying to get... But I think that, you know, I'm not going to do things to please someone, but I think if that person has a point, I am happy to get some money. So I was able to get the most money, so that person was like, ‘Oh, yeah [Participant 13], you're good. I don't know how you did it.’"
Participant,"And then the important thing is that you work very hard, but you don't want to look like you work very hard. [laugh] Especially for Asian, I'm not kidding you! Um yeah so..."
Interviewer,"Can you tell me about that, you don’t want to look like you’re working..."
Participant,"I don't want to look very hard. Because then people will discount—well, and then also there's like Asian stereotype, about like you're supposed to work hard all the time. And I kind of don't want to reinforce that, I don't want to work Asian hard, does that make sense? There's a ‘work hard’ and an ‘Asian hard.’ And I think sometime, my husband work Asian hard. My husband that, you know, like every holiday like he's in the field computers, so like you know—every holiday, like every weekend, and people just kind of expect him to work. And then they will tell him, ‘Thank you,’ but just kind of expect him to work. Yeah, so I think less Asian hard, when you have to work holiday, and the weekend. And I don't want to work Asian hard. I don't want to appear to work Asian hard. I think you have to work hard, I'm trying to work smart. And then, understand that, you know, sometimes some people, we're just not going to get an a well and we just can’t. But we still have to work okay together, we don't have to be each other's best friend."
Interviewer,"Sure. So you've actually covered a whole lot, including a lot of questions that I would have asked otherwise, but you kind of already went over them. Is there anything else about your workplace that we haven't discussed that you would want to talk about?"
Participant,"About work in terms of what, being an Asian woman in higher education?"
Interviewer,"Sure, yeah, or anything else."
Participant,"um I think that, in terms of higher education, because I went to a... I was on like a leadership track because you know, mentors say, ‘Hey [Participant 13], you're doing a great job for a program coordinator. Have you thought about you know, maybe like step aside... Because there's another track, right you know, administrative.’ So she actually sent me to like a training. And I realized that sometimes in higher... I realized that in higher education, that Asian woman has a lowest percentage of being in leadership position. Think about President, think about vice provost. I think that, right now, that Black women, with all the years of affirmative action leadership training, Black women are um being recognized and aspire, you know and seen as leaders—in higher higher education. But I do not see that a lot in Asian, well Asian at all that. You may want to look that up, I think something called like the Bamboo ceiling. And especially in higher education, I think higher education probably have like the the lowest percentage or something for women, you know, in that position."
Interviewer,"Why do you think that happened, why do you think that is?"
Participant,"Um. I think there's a combination of a lot of different things. I think the culture, right you know, is one thing. And there's um intersection with gender and culture, and also, I think that parenting responsibility. Because I was thinking about for me, I contemplated in that route, but I decided, I think that's a lifestyle that is a 24/7, you have to be there all the time. And I just kind of don't like to do that, because I focus more on my scholarship. You know, I co-author a textbook, so we are—our textbook actually won an award. [removing filter] Okay, if I get rid of that, do you see an award there? So this is the textbook and then this is the award here."
Interviewer,Up at the top? Oh!
Participant,"So anyhow, so. Because you think about what you want to do for your life and then your family, because I have two children. My husband has depression, so that it won't work well for my family for me to travel, have long hours, and I feel that you know, it’s really important for my family's health and benefit for me to be at home after hour. Because, you know, if I am to take on an administrative position—because right now, I go to work work three days a week—if I am a dean, I need to go there every day, during summer as well. And I kind of like my summer, I can be home doing zoom with you, wear something comfortable, no makeup. And also, I feel that a lot of Asian American women—because I have another colleague that we are about the same age, same time, you know she's a dean already, and she also have children, but she has support. Her husband is very supportive. Her husband want her to get to the top, if she can. And she has family, sister—she can get her kids to her sister's house."
Participant,"But I don't have that kind of things. I don't have family here—well my sister is here but my sister is a different story. She cannot take care of my—you know she cannot play the role of you know, like a backup. She never have children. So I think that you know that uh what I wish that my daughter to have is to have the support. Because, is it possible to have it all? Yeah it's possible, but you need support. You need support. Without support you just can’t. Well, like you know, it kind of depends on what are you willing to sacrifice, right? Because I think that I can see that a lot of Asian women that really, you know, because when you're here, you have family. Yeah you want to be involved with your family, with your children especially, you know when they’re young. You need to have a flexible job, I mean our job is flexible. You know, like, for example, I don't have to be in my office to do work-work, I can do work when kids are asleep."
Participant,"So what do you think, I'm curious too. I don't know, I don't know why. I think there's something to do with culture. And then women are definitely not, you know, in terms of percentage of women in leadership position if we're using that as a measuring for success. It depends on how you measure leadership and success, I guess, because I think if you asked my kids, you know, they will tell you, ‘Mommy's definitely the leader in the family.’ But that's our family, but my husband is the one who—he support me as well. Like, for example, 4th of July coming up. I always say, ‘Okay, where do you want to go? We can do like a one-day trip or two-day trip, okay. Like can you come up with like five possibilities that we can talk about?’ So he will look up five possible places, and we can talk about it, but he won’t have to try. But I'm the one who say, okay let's do this, let's do this, and then, so I think it's a really more of a teamwork. More of a teamwork. But I do think that—and then another time that I feel that Asian women are being polite sometimes was perceived as not assertive enough. And then sometimes when we being polite um apologize for things we didn't do and we're seen as weak. So that's something we might want to think about."
Interviewer,Sure. Do you think the same thing happens to Asian men or to other women of color?
Participant,"Yeah, yeah. And I know my husband has an Asian awakening after Covid because I think he didn't realize he has been... um he didn’t know. He didn't know that—he didn't realize that all the years that he has been passed by for promotion—he was put in the tech, but he’s like at the top of the tech whatever position. But there's no more because you have to become management, then you then you have more, right, you know you can climb the ladder. But he’s at the top of the technical track, um but he's 58 and he is... Yeah so so he just realized that during Covid. Because they know there were a lot of mistreatment of Asian Americans and then you know the girls were more aware of things that’s happening, and reading, so actually he had an awakening moment. He’s like, ‘Oh.’ So he actually asked his boss to give him some answer and his boss—well, his boss didn’t do anything but then he didn't follow up—so anyhow. Yeah, yeah, he was making some noises but I don't think it was very effective because the talk didn't do anything, he didn't follow up and there's no action. Yeah, so. I think that it is not just, you know, I'm sure that, you know, I think the Asian um we just have different, you know... There are different, you know this, we have... there are different stereotype or even ethnic minority and yeah..."
Interviewer,"Sure, sure."
Participant,So is this your PhD right? Yeah? So is this your dissertation or just a research project?
Interviewer,um this is kind of like a midway project that I have to. Um it's called our second-year paper but it's a misnomer because people write it in their third or fourth years a lot. Um but yeah I'm working on it for sort of like a master's thesis if that makes sense.
Participant,So you're doing a qualitative research right?
Interviewer,yeah yeah.
Participant,"yeah this is yeah, this is the yeah yeah you know, to get the juicy stuff you need qualitative research."
Interviewer,"Sure, sure. No this has been great um. I have a couple of demographic questions for you, but I think you've already answered them all. Um yeah because you said—did you say where you were born?"
Participant,"Taiwan—in Taipei. Yeah, Taipei Taiwan until like 20 and then we move to the States."
Interviewer,got it yeah um oh can you tell me your gender pronouns?
Participant,"Oh, she/her."
Interviewer,"Okay, cool yeah I think you answered all the other ones already. So yeah I know you have to go soon. Thank you so so much for doing this, it's really helpful, so I appreciate it very much."
