Unknown,Participant 17
Interviewer,"Okay, so first of all, do you mind introducing yourself and just telling me a little bit about who you are, where you're from, your education, and brief employment history?"
Participant,"Sure that's my name is ___. Currently, I’m a VP of corporate legal at (company name) Therapeutic, a biotech company in Cambridge. I grew up in North Carolina when I was younger. So I was born in Korea. I moved to North Carolina when I was about a year and a half, and I spent about 11 and a half years there, and then I moved back to Korea when I was 13. So I kind of did, I think, the reverse of a lot of people like Asian Americans in the United States, and I actually had to learn Korean and learn about Korean culture when I was a teenager, which was not probably the easiest thing at the time, but I went to junior high, high school and college in Korea, and then I started working at a big multinational company for a few years and decided that I wanted to go to law school in the United States. So I moved to New York to go to law school, and then I got a job at a big law firm in New York City, and I was there for a couple of years before the firm that I was at opened an office in Seoul Korea. So without…so I went back to Korea to work in the film office and be part of like the first team heading that up for six years and then… So family, like my family, Like my husband and my two children decided we wanted to go back to the States, and spend more time with my husband and researchers here, so we moved back to the Boston area for about four years ago, and we've been here, ever since."
Interviewer,"Great, yeah. so in your current role as vice VP of corporate legal, what exactly does that mean and what do you do day to day?"
Participant,"Yeah so I joined the company name after we did our IPO, so after we went public, and my background is in corporate security, like securities offering and SEC, Corporate Governance public disclosure, that kind of area of the law. So I do a lot of work relating to our external communications and SEC filings, like press releases and public disclosures. I'm very involved in that. I'm also involved in any financing transactions that our contemplating are doing, or other strategic transactions and collaboration that we're working on. I'm also… because we're a pretty small legal team, like our company's about 300 employees, and we have about 910 people on our legal team, I'm also involved in a lot of non-corporate and security matters, but also like women and other aspects of the law that… I feel like I'm branching out into from with my specialized area that I was focused on whenever that a law firm."
Interviewer,"Sure sure. So at your job, are you…you're interacting with other people quite a bit, right?"
Participant,That's correct.
Interviewer,"Do you interact with customers or clients, in addition to colleagues, or mostly just internal work?"
Participant,"It's mostly internal. Sometimes when we're working on some sort of strategic transaction and there, or like a contract negotiation, and I do work with external parties, whether it's their external counsel or the counterparty itself. They also communicate a lot with our law firm, so there’re external Councils."
Interviewer,"Gotcha um, how do you feel about your job? If you were to rate it on a scale from one to ten, what would you give it?"
Participant,I think I would give it a nine. I love my job.
Interviewer,That's great yeah.
Participant,"I think it could be because I was at a law firm for a long time. So any job is a good job if it’s not a law firm job. But I really love…I love what we're doing. I love like that the legal team has a big role in various aspects of the business, and we are a voice that I think influences, and it's also asked to influence and be a part of a lot of decision-making, so yeah. It's great. It's really fun, and I feel like there's so much more like practical considerations that I consider because I'm a part of the discussion, which is different from when I was at a law firm, where you're kind of brought in to do the execution of something that's already been decided. And then, like even after like executing something, like at a law firm, once like the money's there, and things are done. And you’re kind of outside. You don't know what happens afterwards."
Participant,"At a company like this, you have to live with whatever agreement that you signed, or whatever money that you raised, or whatever it is. So just understanding and being a part of that, it's really exciting, and it's fun."
Interviewer,That sounds really awesome. Is it ever stressful?
Participant,"Um yeah, it is stressful. I think relatively it's not very stressful compared to like how stressed I was when I was at a law firm. But there are stressful situations. Thinking like communication is always something that has to be really thoughtful.  So yeah so it's just sometimes it's stressful to think about how to communicate things well, like who needs to know, how people should know, like when people should know, and like there's a hiccup in the communication, and that could be stressful."
Interviewer,"What's the culture, like or like the overall atmosphere at your workplace?"
Participant,"I think it's really dynamic. It's really a fast-moving organization where we're a clinical-stage biotech company with no revenue and no product. So there's an urgency to get things done really quickly, where…we have to raise money in order to fund our operations, and so we don't have like product revenue coming in that's organically going to fund the things that we do, or what we want to do. So I think there's… it's a high-pressure environment. It's high risk, high return. So anything that trickles down to everything that we do, but I do think there's like a lot of excitement and a lot of passion because we're working in an industry where we can make a difference to people who really need it. And also, I think there's a hyper-focus on communication, how much we can share both externally and internally because we're a public company and a lot of the information that we have is for confidential material. So both from a compliance perspective and from a competitive standpoint, we're very careful, or we should be very careful so that I think that inevitably bleeds into the culture. It's not like we're a private company, where we can say whatever we want to say. There are not a lot of repercussions. Or you can control the information tightly because we're a small company and we're growing so quickly. Those are the concerns, but yeah…and I think it becomes part of the culture, to be aware of what the concerns are."
Interviewer,Is it a pretty friendly place? Would you consider your colleagues to be also friends or is it pretty professional?
Participant,"I think it's actually pretty friendly. I think it's… yes, I can get pretty casual, pretty friendly. I think it’s…I joined when we were about 150 employees, and now we were about 300. So I think now it feels much bigger, and I feel like I don't know everybody, whereas when a few months after I joined, or at least a year into when I joined, I felt like I knew everybody and everybody knew me. But still, I think, other than the people that I still haven't caught up to yet, I think it’s a very friendly environment and very casual. And it's possible to have just personal conversations. And just be more like you don't have to be remote and professional all the time, and you can share. You know you can complain, or like share what's going on with people that I feel comfortable with, of course. Yeah."
Interviewer,How does that compare to your experiences at the law firm?
Participant,"I think when I was in the law firm,  there I think…there’re tears of people, the pockets of people. With your external clients, definitely, it's going to be professional. And with like …with partners like you're not… I think it's professional there too. It's really… there's not a lot of need or desire to be friends with the partners that you're working for, but I think with associates you're kind of…It's like boot camp. You're going to get a lot of stress together, and there's a lot of pressure, so I think it was… I mean, the fun part was yeah I had a lot of really good colleagues that I could be with or just commiserate with. So a lot of my really good friends now are actually friends that I met through the law firm I was at, so I think I'm fortunate, and I feel, like all my work environment, so I was at a multinational Company before I joined, I went to law school, and even there, it was very… I had good friends like that I'm still friends with now and yeah."
Interviewer,Did it feel hierarchical and what about your current company?
Participant,"At my current company, I think it's hierarchical, but I don't I think…I think it's hierarchical because there is a leadership team. I'm the VP, which is, I guess, more senior than most of the organization. But it's very clear that there are a level of roles, but I don't think…so I guess it's two like… there's clear like reporting lines and structure. But I don't think that drives a wedge between people and interacting on a personal level like I could joke around with like our CEO or CFO. For my former manager, I feel like I'm not comfortable doing that, but I do think it's still like hierarchical in that sense that you have instructor but that doesn't mean you can't speak up if you're just a week being here or you're not like a.. you know, you don't have like a higher title in somebody else."
Interviewer,"To what extent, would you say you feel like you can be yourself at work or do you find that sometimes you have to act a certain way?"
Participant,"Yeah I think that's a really good question, I think… generally, I feel pretty comfortable like being myself at work, but I know I've been at this company for two years now, so I feel like, you know, I have like four currency here. Like I know a bunch of people and a bunch of people know me. I'm trusted, so it feels comfortable, and I don't have to like put on a different front to be able to influence or to try to gain authority or anything like that. I think when I first joined, I wasn't sure what kind of order just was, so I think in the beginning, I didn't feel super comfortable, like no. And I was brought in as an expert on a particular area, as an expert on public company operations, on SEC filings. And there, you know, my boss, who is the chief legal officer, has a lot of experience, and he's great and awesome and amazing, and I really love working with him, but you know, the idea was that I would come in and I had the more like specialized technical expertise so I'd be able to run with all of that. So I felt like I had to behave and talk and show my authority, you know, with confidence, but I felt like I could do it, too. And it was challenging in the beginning, in the sense that, because we were totally newly public,  it wasn't like I could just do what we did before, or anything like that. It was I kind of had to make up…make things up like make, you know, set up the systems and processes. This is being in the way that I thought made sense and worked for us, rather than just kind of like doing it the way that it was done before because it was never done before. And then also requires like educating people like who may not be so familiar with. They’re…Most people were there when we were not public, so at a private company. So the understanding of like “Oh, we can’t really… can't just fix that. It's not in the public domain. We need to be…we can't just sell shares or buy shares of our company, because it feels like we have a really good price,” so things like that. Kind of getting fining and education on what my area or my contribution to the company, where I think was important, so it was more stressful in the beginning."
Participant,"I feel like we have like a good understanding and I have a good relationship here with most people or with just the organization generally,  so I don't feel like I have to like proof. I mean not that I am not going to do a good job, but it's not like I have to prove myself on every single thing or like make sure I come across a certain way I could. I feel more freedom to just be the way I am without having to think too much about it. I think one thing, though, that I always have kind of struggled with mostly working in the States versus working in Korea: they do think I have like the interesting perspective of…So when I worked at GE, I worked in Korea and in the corporate headquarters in Stamford Connecticut, so I had the same organization, pretty much the same job at the same level, but in two different office locations, with different cultural environments and being everything Korean in a Korean office and being Korean in a US-based office. It’s different. And the same thing when I was at a law firm, at the law firm, which is clearly godly, so I was in the New York office, you know, and then I was also in the Seoul office and working with clients that were faced, you know, that were in the US, when I was in the New York office versus Korean clients, who are pretty much like 98% of the clients said that they worked with Seoul office.  So that was very different experience. I think the job was the same, but very different experience, and I feel like how I communicated, how I, you know, brought myself to like the work environment was different, and it was I think more natural in Korea. I felt like it was easier like, and it was so much easier and so many different ways, and that's something that I think about a lot. Because they feel like when I'm…when I was working in Korea. I have a better understanding or better of gut instinct feeling of like the counterparty, like who my audience is, like what their background is, what they're expecting, like how I can more effectively communicate with these people versus people in the United States maybe. I know I need a little bit more effort. Maybe be more proactive or show that I'm more confident, something that yeah. It's like a little bit more work for me to do that, and it could only speak like that the comfort level. Yeah and like just understanding of expectations, which is different, yes."
Interviewer,"What are some of the other differences, specifically that you notice between working in the Korea office versus working in the US?"
Participant,"I think working in Korea office, another thing that's easier is they're like this known thing about myself that I think it makes it easy without having to… like what's the right way to say it? Like currency, like you know, what school I went to, like what people I know, like what connections. Like it's not like I have like some like, you know, extensive connections or anything but there's like a lot that's just a common understanding that's like “oh, you know, I think I already have some credibility like with those basic credentials.” But I feel like, in this case, like I don't have that. It's like I have to like… It's all on the merits, which is, I mean, I think everything should be on the merits, but human nature, I feel like it's not that way. So it's easier if you already have credibility because you know somebody knows “oh the school, I went to the same school; oh, I know that school. It’s like a great school.” or my… you know some…."
Interviewer,Which school did you go to?
Participant,I went to Yonsei university.
Interviewer,Yeah yeah.
Participant,Yeah. We can fund travel. We can take ride everywhere. So even something like that it just makes it easier…
Interviewer,Yeah.
Participant,"Like I went to law school here and like went to get firm and all that, but it's not…I just need to like show…I feel like I need to show people that I'm confident in my job more than I feel… I feel like when I'm in Korean, it feels like there's just a lot…Does it sound like a lot of fracking? (laugh) Like that speaks for itself, yes, I must be like a certain level of, you know, have some certain level of diligence and hard work ethic to get, you know, to get different grades. Not that means everything but it... I think it just helps in establishing like the initial."
Interviewer,"Sure, you’re greasing the wheels there."
Participant,"Yea, exactly."
Interviewer,Do you ever feel like your race or your gender or your age matter with how you're treated or how people view you when you're working?
Participant,"Yes, totally. Yeah I think it totally matters. I think people, whether they admit it or not, or whether it's conscious or not, you all have certain biases and I have been myself, so I think being female, there are definitely certain stereotypes and expectations that are touched. Being Asian, I feel like that's the big thing. There's a link, you know, the model minority. Like the foreigners concept like that. It's hard not to be aware of those unconsciously. Yes, for sure, and age as well. I think if you're yeah… I think definitely there are certain general generational stereotypes that play again. Yet even things for me, like, I have a very high pitched voice, and I’ve been told time and again. And at the law firm, I was that… I was even given voice coaching to lower my voice so that I would sound more credible. It didn't work. I tried so hard which maybe I should have so. It's still high pitch, but I think, you know, it's like human nature to respond to what we see and what we hear. So, yes yeah. I do think it influences how people perceive me, and I think for myself as well."
Interviewer,Can you think of any experiences that you've had where that was a prominent or a very salient aspect of what happened? I don't know if you've experienced racial comments or like it's been obvious that you were stereotypes in a certain way or anything like that?
Participant,"Yeah I think, for a variety of factors like this is what I think not necessarily people actually perceive, but I think I am commonly or frequently perceived as being like very compliant, just like pretty passive, nonaggressive. But I think my job… I am a lawyer. A lot of times I want to push back or I feel like “yes like this is something that I'm going to push back on” or “that's my job to do.” I should push back so like if I'm pushing back or arguing for like a point or negotiating something and I could be… at the end of the day, like I wanna get what's best for my client or what I think is beautiful and it might be more aggressive, and, you know, people didn’t think it’s necessary…but I think they’re surprised that no like I didn't think you were gonna be pushing back, but you are so… it's not necessary to be tied to like my race or my gender, but I feel like people are more surprised than they would be if I were like a white male."
Participant,"Yes, and like sometimes it's taken to… I feel like the reaction is stronger than if it was expected like if. If they were expecting me to push back, if they were expecting me to be aggressive, and then I can counter reaction both… It can cut both ways sometimes. I get like a phone slammed on me. Okay, what you must be saying it’s really has keys because I didn't expect you to come out so strongly on this. You know I will like I'll entertain it, and act at it like quicker, so I think it cuts both ways, not necessarily always favorable to me or always unfavorable to me. But I think that is definitely something I've experienced. And yeah I'm just trying to think of any like another concrete example. I think it's some… yeah no, I don't know if I've experienced anything like very overtly racist. I think its more of like the stereotypical perception versus maybe actual like what actual actions or things that I do that sometimes there's a disconnect that I can… It could be me being like sensitive to it, too, but I do think it says....In regard to other things which to me,  it doesn't bother me so much, but it seem to the potential like… Actually, what bothers me more is like people feeling uncomfortable about asking me, like asking about me, because they feel like they're not sure like how to ask to not offend. Like the whole idea of like asking, you know, people where are they from. I feel like for white people or people who are very clear they're probably like Ohio, or somewhere else, that's like an easy answer to both say and to hear people get asked. I feel like sometimes that people won't ask me that question because they don't know what to expect and they don't want to offend which, I mean, I understand. But yeah."
Interviewer,But you can tell that they want to know they just aren't asking.
Participant,"Yeah, you can tell they want to know, like yeah whether I'm from…like it's probably where whether I'm from China or from Japan or Korea that's what I think the assumption is but they don't know how to ask yeah which is fine, too, I mean I think if you're like close friends and it's a personal relationship like you can find a way to ask, you know, in a way that's not offensive, and I would be I wouldn't be offended either, but it's like you know relationships for that, where you're not really…you don't really have a relationship, and you're kind of dancing around things that you're curious about."
Interviewer,"Sure, sure. So in this study I'm particularly interested in how people experience and express their emotions that work. So, first of all, what kind of emotional person are you? Do you feel like you're very open and feel a lot of feelings, or are you more reserved and private about what you're feeling?"
Participant,"I think I'm pretty open. So if I'm frustrated, they're not like… they've been frustrated and annoyed I like fence about it. Yeah and if I'm like happy and my plateau like halfway shared that voice the people around me. I feel like I'm pretty open. It's hard for me to shut it off so maybe I should more (laughs)."
Interviewer,Can you think of any times when you felt particularly emotional at work?
Participant,"Yes, I feel like I am…Yeah I think I don't know like whether it severely, but when I feel like something isn't…I feel like this a lot with our external law firm. They're very annoying. I feel like they're very annoying, very frustrating, they are not giving a lot of value. So yes, I feel that all the time, and probably talked about it too much and it's not helpful. Also more I guess internally, if I feel like I should be involved in something, but I'm not getting the communication or… yeah actually that's probably the big like I should be involved in something like I'm either because it's a matter that I can handling or…. yeah that's actually like usually the case is something that's in my wheelhouse but I'm not involved, or get involved or I just hear about it, like… After the fact and myself back, we then it's frustrating, and it just feels weird so yeah, then I would…I think what's helpful is I have, I think I have, a pretty good relationship with my manager. And I'm not shy about telling him like what happened and how that makes me feel. So yea, definitely, and I think another frustration like maybe I wish I had better examples of when it's like good emotion, but I feel like when they talk about my emotions.. They will be more like infrastructure already because I'm like I'm in the function that I'm in like it's a lot of… it's a controlling competition."
Participant,"And, from my perspective, I want to be able to say, like what I think we should say without being controlled by others, who I think should not be controlled because some people might…(Laughs) You want to say whatever you want to say. You don't want to let others tell you what you want to say. But I don't use it in any case um yeah I think that… Yea, it's like a fine dance because it could be political like, then you don't wanna… I don't want to alienate people, and I want people to understand that, you know, I'm not doing this for my own my personal benefit. There's like a reason and rationale for the way I think we should communicate and how we should communicate, and what we should communicate. But there's not always an understanding which I totally get as well. Not everybody has to think about it in a certain way or know the context to be able to think about it in a certain way. So that can be frustrating, and then I'm like now I usually share that with my manager, and I can get him to kind of support or help me to resolve the issue. (...) But yeah, I feel I don't know if I guess I'm rambling now, so I don't know if I'm answering your question."
Interviewer,"No that's fine. Yeah no that's good. Do you ever address the situation like outside of, beyond talking to your manager?"
Participant,"Yeah I think the more effective probably approach that I find frustrated with a particular person or particular incident that involves like another person, then being able to talk to that person and like handle or, you know, explain how I'm feeling about it and…Yeah I think that is definitely harder, and it depends a lot on the context. Like with their external law firm, I've had like one or two conversations where I've expressed like “this is not what we're expecting from you guys” but it's like.. it's definitely a hard conversation because I would prefer not to be confrontational. And with a third party like that, we're not… I want us to be the same team, but it’s not necessary lead like.. you might not necessarily thinking that way, thinking internally. I can have the conversation to be like, you know, we're just working and helping each other out, but I think they probably do it in a more balanced way. But I'm hoping that I do get my message across. I feel like I do, but it is more around discussions."
Interviewer,"Does being Asian have anything to do with why you are, you know, speaking in a roundabout way or trying to avoid confrontation or that's just your personality?"
Participant,"I think it's my personality, but I do think it’s probably the way I was raised, like the environment I was raised in, influences that. My parents are Korean. And they were… they're not… I mean there are confrontational Koreans a lot actually, so it's hard to say that it's like a Korean thing or it's a Korean being in a US environment thing because I could see like Asians being in the US being less confrontational because they don't want to bear the brunt of potential with racism or they don't want to be like stereotyped as like an angry Asian or whatever that might be something like I don't want to be the poster child of a certain attribute. So I could I could totally see that. And, just like kind of, like the whole like “just put your head down” and “do your thing” like “don't cause any problems.”"
Participant,"Honestly, I feel like, for me, I probably felt that a little bit when I was growing up to see. Like I grew up in North Carolina where there's not a lot of Asians in my school. I think there’s only Korean in my middle school and probably like two or one out of two or three Asians in the entire student body. I don't think I thought about it so much maybe because it was very few Asians and I just didn't have enough awareness and focus on it. But when I went to Korea, I actually felt that even more because I felt like I've stopped out a time, even though it looks like everybody else so it's ironic, so it looks Korean, so it looks like everything else in Korea is a super homogenous society. But I feel like it's stuck out with a sword. And I could tell very early on that's the path to social suicide in Korea. Like you don't want to speak up; you don't want to raise your hand; you don't know what your voice, you don't want to see different, so I tried very hard when I moved back to Korea to assimilate and to not be like American. Like I even tried to speak like… to try not to pronounce like English correctly, because I didn't want to be seen as like a show-off, you know, the difference, though. Yeah, I think like for me, it's more like a lot of different personal experiences. Maybe my personality and my general like family upbringing more than like being Asian in the US, but I do think the idea of not wanting to speak out is something that influenced my behavior."
Interviewer,"Sure sure, yeah. Okay, can you tell me a little bit more about the composition of the people, or the demographics of the people that you work with in this current job?"
Participant,"Yes, as the company as a whole, we are like 20 to 30 percent Asian and a very small percentage Hispanic or black and the rest is the white population. I think it's very not super diverse like racially. For like the group of people, who I mostly interact with, in the legal team, we have two Koreans. One is my college friend (laughs). So two Koreans and the rest are all… So it's 10 total, so the 8 are all white. And I also work closely with our finance team and our people team. Our finance team, I think, is all white. Oh there, we do have two new hires. One is Asian, and one is Hispanic, but that's like a big group. So 20 people like the large majority are white, and the people team, like the HR team, is also mostly white with one like Jeff half Japanese person."
Interviewer,Sure.
Participant,"And one black person, yeah."
Interviewer,"Got it cool um. Can you think of anything else that…Oh, actually one I forgot, this question: has anything changed about your work situation during the pandemic?"
Participant,"Definitely, like we… so I actually quit the job during the pandemic. And you know, before like at my previous job, I was in person, like in the office all the time. During the pandemic, of course, they all.. company switched to remote so were like a lot of Zoom meetings. And then during the pandemic, I switched jobs, so when I first joined xx, it was all virtual. And to me, that was really difficult to meet people and become part of the organization.  I think we really did a really nice job, trying to make it as easy as possible to be, but I felt like it was really hard and I'm somebody who… I think it’s really important for me to build a relationship and kind of build the trust, especially, I think, because I'm in the legal (team). Like a lot of us sometimes we just have to say like, “no, you can’t do that,” or like “here’s a bunch of comments on this presentation” or… It's not always like we're having the most fun conversations with people. So for me, it's really important to have a relationship that were like the other person can trust that I'm not in it to either act like I'm better than them, or I know more than them, or I'm like just trying to emphasize some sort of like authority just for the sake of it."
Interviewer,Is that ever an assumption people seem to make? Sorry.
Participant,"I feel like it is… I feel like I don't know if it's because I'm a lawyer or because… I feel like it's because I’m a lawyer. That's my assumption that people kind of have to step back and assume that I'm going to be critical that I'm gonna be, you know, that I'm going to…Like maybe being… I don't know what the right word is. Like not snobbish but more like…I'm like…"
Interviewer,Condescending?
Participant,"Yea, condescending. Which is really not the perception that I want people to have."
Interviewer,Sure.
Participant,"Yes, and I think the perception that I would like is that I'm trying to be helpful and trying to, you know, make things easier and smoother, but there’s like boundaries that we keep. So how can we keep the boundaries, but like, you know, get across what…you know, get across what you want to do, or what you like to do may be not exactly the way that you presented. Another way where we can do it in a compliant manner or in a way that's beneficial to us and there's less risk. So I think that's hard to do if you're coming in and out of the blue. I'm kind of parachuting in, not ostensibly because I have this special acknowledge and background, but I don't want to be like “oh I'm the expert, and now I'm going to tell you guys what to do,” because I don’t want our first relationship to be “oh she's a reasonable person. I guess she has the expertise, but now she’s willing to listen to me, listen to us”. I think being humble maybe this could be a cultural thing too like I think being humble is important, and I think it's important for me to be able to do a good job because that means that I am listening and I'm trying to understand because I definitely don't know. I mean I don't know… There's definitely a ton that I don't know, and in order for me to get that information, I need to be a good listener and open to information. And people need to feel comfortable to come to me to give me that information, so I think it's a virtue, but I mean it could be a cultural thing, but I do think it's practical too."
Interviewer,"Sure, sure. In the news over the last couple of years, there's been a rise in API hate incidents. I don't know if you've seen them, but have you been aware of that, and has it affected you at all?"
Participant,"Yeah for sure. So definitely aware of a lot that's been going on, I think I know you spoke with (name) before, but apparently, she had started an initiative here. And she actually is shown to me the Batman shooting incident and asked me if I'd be willing to like we'd have a discussion at the company and what's been going on with the API violence, especially after the Covid.  So we put together a pretty informal discussion with like all the people who identify that Asian in the Community. I co-shared it with another colleague here. We mean it was like a really good like candid open conversation when I felt like we created a safe space for people to talk about these things which I think many of us probably felt like “Oh, this is not a conversation for the workplace.” That to me like it's been really horrible, all the things that have gone on. Anything it's really shed a light on how much racism is out there, and how much violence is out there, which I think is like the silver lining to all of the trauma, but it also is being got…At least for me to like really think about what (name) said and what I can do, because I think I didn't really identify as Asian American just because, you know, I kind of feel like I'm a middle person Like I flipped in Korea. I keep on going back and forth, like every couple of years. Like technically I'm Korean, and I don't have citizenship and who knows where I'm going to be in the next couple of years, but it did make me realize that I am Asian and I'm living in the US. So yes, like I am Asian American in that context, regardless of what the technical definition is. And my kids. So I have two young kids so far, Asian and growing up in the US, so it matters and having conversations and understanding matters. so. So we actually did that like an informal discussion among Asian people here, and then we did another broader session to the full company about how the bystander intervention integrating them over about a few islands over history with a medical history. So that was both like educational and also just like and bringing people into… Like this is not just something that affects Asians that you can be a part of it too, and sometimes people just don't know what to do and how do you have so that that was great, but it was a really great question, so I lived that with another colleague, a small, and this year. This year we did something again so we did another kind of like discussion session for any PR heritage month. And the idea was really to sell one to like celebrate the diversity of patients like a vacation means a lot of different things, and a lot of different people with different cultures and heritage isn't that cities are classified in this one word engine and also kind of to highlight maybe some of the things that your research is focusing on to like you know the concept of being a perpetual perpetual foreigner like what do you think when people ask you like Where are you from like what's your reaction like."
Interviewer,How know... how like... what conversations have you had and like what does it mean for you to be Asian like within the workplace?
Participant,"Like there's the whole concept of like you know Asians being hard workers but not really leadership. And how like, why is that and how. If you could go back just a couple of things I don't know when you cut out exactly but.  Oh, did you get the part about the current panel or or no. yeah the current the I know you were talking about how. What came up for people when you when they're asked where they're from."
Interviewer,That's where it.
Participant,"yeah okay got it yeah and then we also talked about like what like any challenges. That people face like location in the US, whether it's like the assumption that you are just a hard worker, but not leadership material that, how can we change that perception is that a perception that can be changed. What are some of that like just challenges of being team what other like ending know even like I think the day today like things that they think a lot of people are just like us to being called like certain names. And being treated in certain ways that you know I feel like a lot of times people to stay fresh off to see like too much stress to like deal with it on a day to day basis. Fixing that and what it means to be thinking what it what it what it even means to be Asian like what is that word. So we have like it was like it was so good, it was, we had a lot of participation and then we have a small group sessions, where people could. break out top of whether they were Asian or not can all talk about your heritage, you know, and some of these questions that we post people. anything to take away one. For a lot of the Asian people think they were felt validated that we were having these conversations at work and think a lot of the things that people very much. No pay identifying with but It just seems like it's so minor to like bring it up like it's like."
Participant,"This is something that we deal with and it's not a big deal, like all Asian deal with it and it's not something that rises to the level of violence or something that so many sure that you can deal with it seems like you're complaining. But so that was really great that I think we were able to bring this topic up in a way, but then also and from like the non.  prospecting we heard a lot about. We learn like so much that I never thought about which was great too, but also like we had a little group of people who thought about know how what topics to cover how we're gonna communicating like covered the trainer who were going to like bring in we even had our senior come in. Indian the British Indian and he we had him kind of overall like closer, but all of that, with like two is so there was so much thought put into it and that sounds like exhausting."
Participant,"yeah oh like we have to put into so much thought into how they're going to communicate this in a way that's comfortable, not just for Asian people, but for non-Asian people and that means there's a lot of work to be done and i'm happy that we did it, but it also shows, like how. Yeah how sensitive so well, I could ask you a bunch more questions you're very interesting, but I want to be mindful of our time and I know we're about up to an hour if so."
Interviewer,Is there anything else you would want to talk about that we haven't discussed?
Participant,"No, I think that's good, thank you for having me be part of your study."
Interviewer,"Yes, thank you so much. Did you mention your age or do you mind telling me your age?"
Participant,"Oh, not at all. I am 42 I believe."
Interviewer,That that's your American each that you're Korean age.
Participant,My American.
Participant,I think you need and 44.
Interviewer,Yeah yeah they do that.
