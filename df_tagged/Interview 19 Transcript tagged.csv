Unknown,Interview Transcript
Unknown,Participant 19
Interviewer,"So, my first question for you is just can you introduce yourself and tell me a little bit more about who you are, where you're from, and your education and employment background."
Participant,"Sure I'm [Participant 19]. Born and raised in California. I had a 20-year career as a financial controller for enterprise before retiring and going to vet school. And I went to UGA just recently, and recently opened up my own clinic um here in Alpharetta, Georgia."
Interviewer,"Congratulations, by the way."
Participant,"thank you. Um I'm sorry, you said something else about educational background, if that's important I can reiterate, I can go over that too."
Interviewer,Um sure yeah.
Participant,"OK, so my undergrad degree is in sociology from UCLA. I have a master's degree from San Francisco State in Business Administration, and then I have my veterinary degree from UGA."
Interviewer,got it. Very interesting.
Participant,"I know, crazy."
Interviewer,"No, I love it. And can you tell me a little bit more about your current role and what you do at your own practice?"
Participant,"yeah so I'm the veterinarian and owner. I started this clinic. The seed was planted a couple years ago, but it recently opened, delay due to COVID. So we opened at the very end of March. And I'm the sole practitioner here, team of three employees and we specialize in low cost spay/neuter surgeries for cats and dogs."
Interviewer,"gotcha and you said you were a financial controller, what was that about? Like what was that like and what did you do there?"
Participant,"yeah so I got in uh a long time ago, 1993 I think. Maybe even longer I'm sorry, yeah 1993 I believe. When the company was really small and I started off in accounting, as an accounts payable clerk. It was a company that allowed me to grow and develop with them and so as they became larger, I moved up the food chain. Become a supervisor, a financial accountant, eventually a business manager, and then a controller and it's about learning how to run your own operations, like they're all separate entities and you have separate performance statements and profit and loss statements. And it's about managing a business with employees and it's essentially running your own business without your own money—so entrepreneurship."
Interviewer,"Sure, and this was out in California or..."
Participant,"Yeah. So enterprise is global, but I started off in California and it's a company where um promotions are based on the ability to be mobile and transfer. So started in California, went to Minnesota, then was promoted to Las Vegas, North Carolina, Montana, Georgia."
Interviewer,All over the place
Participant,"Yeah, all over the place and that's when I took an early retirement in 2009 and that's when I decided to go to that school. And since I was here in Georgia, I applied to UGA, in state tuition, can't beat that so."
Interviewer,Right yeah. Sure.
Participant,"yeah so and then I stayed here afterwards, because I like it here."
Interviewer,How do you feel about your current job and how did you feel about your previous role?
Participant,"I felt like I got very lucky in my previous role because I found a company that suited my desire to move up, and they rewarded the ambition, they rewarded your independence, they rewarded—you know you got in you got out of it as much as you put into it, and that was a relationship that I needed to have because I didn't want to wait for tenure, didn't want to wait for somebody to move on, didn't want my career to be affected by somebody else's termination or leaving. So it was a great fit for me. And I always felt like I got a fair shake um 90% of the time. It was—maybe still is—a very heavily um male dominated industry and there's no getting around that. But I felt like for the most part, things were very fair and things were handled very appropriately. And in my role here, obviously, as a business owner and as the person in charge, um I hope that my employees feel like things are fair and equitable but it’s just a different type of responsibility."
Interviewer,"Right, right. If you could rate your jobs on a scale from 1 to 10, what would you give them?"
Participant,"Right now, my job?"
Interviewer,That one and the previous one.
Participant,"The previous one, I would say, for all up until the very last year of my  employment, I would have rated it a 10. The last year kind of got a little choppy, yeah, which was probably the catalyst for me moving on. But here uh this is tricky, you know, it's hard, it's something that I haven't done, I never wanted to be a business owner, I always felt very comfortable playing, you know, the second in charge or the VP role, and this is just a little uncomfortable for me. So I'm like squirming at an 8 right now."
Interviewer,still getting used to it a little bit?
Participant,"Yeah, there's just a lot of things that go into this business that you don't—you realize what your deficiencies are. Like marketing is not my thing and it's not something I ever had to do except to hire a good marketing manager. And when you are like, you know, you are responsible for it all, then you end up having to do things that you're not really good at, and i'm not good at that."
Interviewer,"Sure. Can you tell me what you feel like the culture and overall, like, vibe of your office is."
Participant,"yeah so right now we're all a little bit on the sick side health-wise so it's come down in the dumps, but these are employees that all used to work with me that chose to come with me to open this clinic. So we started off on a really good footing, um we knew each other, we knew the dynamics of our personalities, they knew what my expectations were and how I managed as a vet and as a manager. So they knew what they signed up for, they were okay with it, and so we kind of all um we work well together. And I hope that they are happy um I think that the way that they perform when I'm not around is a pretty good indication of, you know, how much effort you put in and they put the same amount of effort in, whether I'm here or not. And they're looking out for the company and they're looking out for sharing in the benefits of growth and they all just go above and beyond."
Interviewer,"Sure. Do you interact with people a lot at work, on a day-to-day basis?"
Participant,"The employees, yes, we are all in a very small clinic attached at the hip and, as far as external contact clients, yes, and we all have to now because we're the only ones here. Um yeah there's quite a bit of interaction, I would say."
Interviewer,What is that like? Do you feel like you can be yourself when you're in those interactions or do you feel like you need to act a certain way?
Participant,"um I think that we try to keep things professional. There’s definitely, I think, professional etiquette that needs to be upheld in a work environment. Everything from the way we look, dress, act, talk and all of that. And luckily it's not terribly different from who we each are as individuals, but I think it's up to me to set the standard and to be the role model for that and I like to keep it pretty on the up and up so."
Interviewer,Sure um. Do you ever have clients vent to you or colleagues?
Participant,Of course.
Interviewer,And do you vent to them or not really?
Participant,"um I think it's our role to read our audience and to be there for them and to make them feel heard and but it's not necessarily our place to reciprocate while on the job. What they do on their own time over a glass of wine, whatever, that's fine I think, but while we're here, we can lend a ear, but we're just here to—we're here, on the clock doing work, so I don't feel like that's appropriate."
Interviewer,got it yeah um. Can you tell me a little more about the gender and race dynamics or demographics and your office?
Participant,"Yeah so my business manager um is of Latin descent um she's a second generation, I think, her parents migrated over here from—uh I don't know, now I can't remember, but some South American country. Gosh [Interviewer], now you're making me feel horrible because I can't remember where. But anyway, she's fluent in Spanish, and she came from very humble beginnings, they had a rocky start and are now making the dream come true in America. My other tech is born and raised here. I don't know what exactly her race is but she's White/Caucasian and single female. And then my other tech is from Spain. So, she came over here quite a while ago and has gained her citizenship here, and she is fluent in both English and Spanish uh yeah. And then there's me, so I'm also a second generation, my parents were from Japan and they migrated here many years ago uh got their citizenship and then I was born in the States."
Interviewer,"Sure, so it's all women at your office?"
Participant,"Yes, all women."
Interviewer,"What about when you were a controller, what were the like kind of demographics like there? You mentioned that it was heavily male dominated."
Participant,"yeah um white male not very diverse and there was a few female scattered within the profession. At the upper ranks, they got fewer and further in between. They were starting to change by the time I left, which was 2009, but when I started, which was in the early 90s, it was very much a not diverse environment."
Interviewer,"Um, did you ever feel singled out or like you were you stood out for your race or gender?"
Participant,"Um no, but we would joke about the fact like when we did diversity training and stuff that when you get to be—and you have to understand, you're probably too young to remember when the workplace allowed for all kinds of what's today considered sexual harassment and when you hire without taking into account any diversity and things like that, and so it was a very different time back then. And so we used to joke about the fact that if you were a female over the age of 40 and of a minority, that it was going to be really hard to get fired because they needed to have you as a statistic, in order to be able to promote diversity in the workplace or to appear to be non-biased. So when all that started coming about, there was there was a lot of joking about that kind of stuff going on. And that's when—um I don't know that I ever really questioned whether or not I was there because I fit this certain demographic profile or not. I didn't ever really feel that way. Well you know, like Asians are programmed from birth like to be really hard working and I grew up with a tiger mom and like we studied while the other kids played. And so I felt like I was pulling my own weight when I was there, maybe even doing more than most. But that was just work ethic that was ingrained in me from my parents, not from anybody else."
Interviewer,Do you feel like it was an expectation at all that you worked that hard or not really?
Participant,"From my parents, yes. And I think that you know when you go to school, everybody expects Asians to be smart. And that was not me, that was not the case, like, I had to work twice as hard, study twice as long to get the same grades as everybody else. Like I'm not one of those magical Asians that comes with an IQ that is super smart, so I always felt cheated, because they would hire me or they would put me in a role and expect just for it to come naturally and it never came naturally to me. So, I don't know, maybe I'm the anomaly, maybe I'm just too Americanized, maybe I just—I don't know I got stocked with the wrong genes, I guess."
Interviewer,I don't know about that. It seems that you succeeded in several different industries so yeah. Don’t sell yourself short.
Participant,there's a lot of tenacity. I make up in tenacity what I lack in just regular brain cells. Failure was not an option when I was a kid.
Interviewer,"Did you ever experience like discrimination or—I mean I guess what you were describing was racial comments and maybe like some sort of stereotyping, but not necessarily in a way that bothered you. Did you ever experienced some that did or no?"
Participant,"yeah, I guess, I was really fortunate in that I didn't. Um you also have to understand that when I grew up, I grew up in California, and California is kind of a melting pot. So I'm sure that, you know, if you grew up here in the south, you got treated very differently than the way I got treated. And you were probably not even born when this happened, but are you familiar with affirmative action?"
Participant,Interview: yeah
Participant,"okay, so when affirmative action took place, I was actually really taken aback and almost offended that it was happening because that essentially made people look at me like I got into schools because I was Asian and a minority, instead of getting there on my own merit. And I got in on my own merit and I got lumped in with all these other Asians that got in because they needed to fill a statistic. And so it was almost like a reverse discrimination for me. And I know that I'm the weirdo, I probably don't fit your study profile at all, and I'm going to like going to wreak havoc on your study."
Interviewer,no profile
Participant,"But I’m one of those people who just did not appreciate that at all. I wanted everything to be done based on merit and may the best person get the job. Um I never felt like I got the job because I was a certain minority, and I never felt like I didn't get the job because I was a female minority so. Maybe I was just naive."
Interviewer,What about with clients in your current role? Have you ever experienced any sort of stereotyping as a veterinarian?
Participant,"I think that I again, I feel like I'm awarded a pass just because I'm a minority and they take my word without too much arguments and they take my word as like Gospel, for the for the most part. And I don't know if that's good or bad, but I don't get challenged. And I think it's because the expectation is, ‘Oh she's Asian and she's a vet and she must know what she's talking about.’ So, no, I almost get the reverse; I don't get challenged at all."
Interviewer,"Sure, that's very interesting."
Participant,"Yeah weird, right? And then, when I was in school because I went to school so late—um I don't know if [mutual acquaintance] told you, but I went to school when I was 44. And so I'm like the oldest kid in the class right. So, when I walk in, automatic respect and I'm just a student—I'm the student and the actual doctor is probably 20 years younger than I am and they're calling me, you know, ‘Dr. [Name]’ and I'm like, ‘no, no, I'm just a student here.’ And even teachers would give me uh just the graciousness because I was older. And I really—I mean I probably didn't deserve that at all so it's just weird."
Interviewer,This was in vet school or in undergrad?
Participant,in vet school.
Interviewer,"Vet school, gotcha um. So, in the study I'm particularly interested in how people feel and express emotions at work. Are you an emotional person, first of all, and would you say that you wear your, you know, your emotions on your sleeve or that you tend to be more reserved or private?"
Participant,"So, by the fact that I was in a male dominated environment, you were not allowed to wear your emotions on your sleeve—that was a sign of weakness. And you never wanted to cry or show any kind of volatility or any kind of irrational [air quotes] ‘women's emotion’ in that type of environment, so I was programmed pretty early on to um not wear my emotions on my sleeve, and to essentially suck it up. And if I was frustrated, I got frustrated on the way home in the car or I vented to my husband when I got home but sorry. [phone interruption] Sorry [Interviewer] I was left with the phones to myself."
Interviewer,"Oh no worries. Um you cut out at the very end of what you were saying. So you were talking about how you would maybe sometimes go home and talk to your husband, but you didn't show any emotions that work?"
Interviewer,--recording paused while participant took phone call--
Interviewer,So you were talking about how you didn't show any emotion that you're old job. But what about at your current job or when you are when you were a vet?
Participant,"Um I am a little bit more relaxed now, the environment is different, and I am able to express emotions a little bit more readily, considering it's just me here. I do have to keep them in check still because I have a very um—I don't want to say volatile personality, but I tend to get excited pretty easily. So I do have to make sure, since there's nobody to keep me in check here, that it’s just me—that we keep things levelheaded and try to think things through. It's a big change from getting managed from your surroundings to managing yourself."
Interviewer,"Sure yeah um. What about like when you're with clients, or when you're with your colleagues, do you ever see them get emotional?"
Participant,"clients get emotional all the time and in the animal welfare world it seems to manifest itself, even more so. Everybody's very attached, animated, emotional about their pets and so that's just something that I've come to realize in this environment, we're not just talking numbers we're talking about animals and lives and I get that. So we get a lot of volatile clients, where you have to just deescalate the conversation. But in terms of our colleagues, I think that I have not seen—I haven't seen much, you know, emotional outbursts and things like that. I do know that in the veterinary profession, we're constantly getting literature about—are you familiar with ‘not one more vet.’"
Interviewer,"no, is that..."
Participant,"It’s a huge movement that took place, because a very prominent veterinarian committed suicide. And the amount of stress that's put on our profession, they started doing this like a couple years ago where attention is being called to talk about the... the suicide rate is much higher in the veterinary profession proportional to other professions and so they're kind of shedding light on that. And I kind of get it because you're if you're not empathetic enough, you're a horrible vet right, and yet there's no work life balance at all, and if you want your pet taken care of, nobody cares whether or not you just went through a 14-hour surgery day, they still want their pet to be looked at. And so it's a very it's a very tricky slippery slope about not getting sucked into that and being able to leave work at work, because there's really no leaving work at work. You get home and then your mom is like, ‘my dog is just’ you know ‘pooped in the kitchen again and blah blah blah,’ and they expect you to give... you know it is what it is. But they also have access to all the medication and all the opioids and all of the things that potentially you could commit suicide with, so it's just a bad situation all the way around and I guess the profession is feeling the strain of the workload, especially through COVID."
Interviewer,"Sure, yeah. Do you ever experience burnout?"
Participant,"It ebbs and flows. You feel really passionate about things, which is why you get in the profession, and then it has to subside at some point. You can't be on, you know, all cylinders, all the time, otherwise you end up having to like suffer health consequences, suffer family consequences, suffer you know work life balance issues and stuff like that so. I do see how that takes place, and for me personally, I just have to back off sometimes and it's time to take a vacation or something like that and do a little self-care."
Interviewer,Sure. Can you think of any times when you felt particularly emotional at work?
Participant,"Yes, and I have got to turn up your volume a little bit, because I can hear you but you’re really, really like soft."
Interviewer,I can try to project more is that better?
Participant,"Because you were fine before. You were doing just fine and I was out here, you just give me a minute here, let me see if my volume can turn up on this thing. I don't... Okay, well, I don't know."
Interviewer,You got louder.
Participant,Oh hey you did too.
Interviewer,"Okay, good."
Participant,"okay perfect. Press enough buttons and I guess it works. Okay, so I'm sorry what was your question again?"
Interviewer,"Can you think of any times when you felt particularly emotional at work, and this could be at either job."
Participant,"Um there have been a couple times in my previous career where I felt that—it's not just emotion—I think I just felt like frustrated to the point where I just wanted to explode, because you were not being heard or you could not get your point across. And to not feel like you have control is a problem for me. So yeah there've been a couple times that I felt this is—I just didn't know how to handle myself."
Interviewer,What did you do in those cases?
Participant,"Um the very first time it happened, I went into the bathroom and I cried. Um, put myself together, came back out, pretend like nothing happened. The second time that it happened—and this is over the span of a 17-year career, so I didn't have very many in these days—but the second time was uh... You’re gonna think this is awful, but my GM and I went into like this horrible argument we were both very, very stressed, I had something thrown at me and I threw something back so [laugh]. That was, I guess that was actually the best one because you got to relieve whatever frustration, you had. And then the third time it happened, that's when I decided that I was going to quit so. Over 17 years, three times, where I felt like these are big mile markers where I just can't deal with it."
Interviewer,"Sure, um. Can you think of any times in your current career?"
Participant,"um yeah I think that—previous to opening this clinic, which is why this clinic got open—was because I was in a position where they had had a management change and the new manager had absolutely no social skills or the ability to comprehend and um take responsibility for anything that went wrong. And it's difficult to work with somebody who has no, I guess sense of self-realization, just not a very mature individual and I'm getting too old to have to deal with trying to help somebody mature and teach somebody how to develop management skills and uh I just expected more from that position."
Interviewer,"sure, sure."
Participant,"And then I was always told, like, if you don't like it here or if you don't like your circumstances, then it's up to you to do something about it right, like, you can't sit there and complain, bring everybody else down or not perform well. That's not acceptable, nor is it part of my nature, so I decided to make myself happy and do something about it so."
Interviewer,"Did you say anything to the manager when, you know, when this was happening or did you feel like you needed to just kind of keep it to yourself?"
Participant,"No, I mean years of management, you know, everybody knows what the appropriate protocol is right. You address it first with the individual that you have a problem with, and then when that does not result in any kind of resolution, you document it, you go through the chain of command. Unfortunately, you know, sometimes that does not work, depending on the dynamics of the organization, depending on the relationships that are there. If somebody hires all their friends in and then there's no way to get to anybody else, and then they tell you to go to HR, if they're in cahoots too, like there's dead ends in organizations. In theory, that should work, right, organizations should make it so that an employee always has an avenue to which they can get heard and get resolution. But in reality, in practicality that doesn't always happen, and in a small organization, especially like in a humane society or animal welfare or you're working with a very small business, sometimes there are no other avenues, and the only avenue is for you to help yourself get to a better place."
Interviewer,"that's fair, yeah. Were there any additional like consequences that you could think of that happened when you were upset in any of these situations?"
Participant,"um there's always collateral damage in one way, shape, or form. Whether it be that you have soured the mood for your employees that day, or whether you have made it unpleasant for a client because you were not yourself that day, or even sometimes like sometimes subpar work is being done on an animal, like maybe we could have treated two more animals that day that had to wait till the next day. Stuff like that, but you know we're human and humans with the best intentions also have breaking points, so in those times, I felt like yeah, definitely, I set the tone for my department and that I'm sure the tone that day was less than stellar. So and that's really unfortunate because that's not something that I like to see happen."
Interviewer,Sure. Do you think other people could tell that you were upset or?
Participant,"Oh sure. Yeah, cuz I'm not a great pretender. And towards the end, when we had already decided that we were going to part ways, and that I was just working out my commitment, you could definitely tell that there was a change in the amount of effort that was being put, in the amount of overtime, in the amount of going the extra mile and stuff like that. Like you know all of those things kind of dissipate as you're coming to a close."
Interviewer,"Has anything been different in in regards to these sorts of situations, since the pandemic or has anything significant changed about your jobs and pandemic?"
Participant,"yeah the pandemic was—I remember when the pandemic first hit, and at that time we were like hitting on all six cylinders, we were going a mile you know like—we were just like cruising down the road, we're trying to get to the next level, we were trying to get from good to great. And so we had all this drive and motivation and all this enthusiasm going on and the pandemic hit, and we were asked to scale back, right like he couldn't come in, you couldn't do the number of animals that you're going to do, you're going to have to find things to do from home or whatever. And I remember thinking, ‘Well, how are people going to be held accountable for this? Like nobody's watching them. We should have organized training going on, during this time,’ and we didn't know how long the pandemic it's going to last but we're like, ‘How are we supposed to justify our hours, we should document what we're doing, we should figure out who's being more productive than others because that's not fair. What are we going to do when it comes time for review time because what if this person sat on their butt and didn't do anything at home. Then this person put together like policies and procedures manuals, or came up with you know,’ like, how do you gauge productivity when everybody's sitting at home? So I remember thinking, gosh, you know, we should be doing other things, and having other matrices and measurements and stuff like that, because to me, you always want to be putting your best foot forward, you want to be earning your pay and when that time comes for promotion or merit increases, you want to be able to justify that. Well, all that got flipped around, and it was super frustrating—super frustrating—and then to see the organization and be like, ‘Oh well, you know, we're just going to trust you guys to do this, and everyone is going to get paid the same.’ And then it just makes your whole morale and everything else kind of like, ‘Why am I working my tail off when nobody else is and we're all getting treated the same? I'm going to go play hooky and go to the gym or whatever.’ And so yeah there was a huge change in that, and I feel like productivity really declined during that time and I don't even think that it's up back to where it was anymore. That whole desire and motivation and drive is gone. I don't know if it's just that environment or if it's just—if it was unique to us, I don't think it was unique to us, because I hear it happening at other places too. But people don't get up at the crack of dawn anymore and wanna put in 14-hour days and try to get to the top of the food chain and stuff like that. They're kind of on cruise control now and—so yeah I think that there was a huge, huge shift in the amount of effort that gets put in at work."
Interviewer,Do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing or neither?
Participant,"I don't know. I don't know. I guess you could see in a number of ways right. Like it's a good thing, maybe we were all going to dig ourselves into an early grave because we were working so hard. Um so maybe that's a good thing, but it's a bad thing productivity-wise. I don't know, it's an interesting question, though."
Interviewer,"At your current practice, would you say productivity is pretty high again, or like you're setting the pace for that right, so..."
Participant,"I am. I don't think it's near what it used to be before the pandemic. I think we're ramping up to that point. But on the days that we're doing 25 surgeries I hear complaints, I hear like, ‘Oh my gosh, my back hurts,’ or ‘We haven't done this in two years.’ And I'm thinking, ‘Yeah, we used to do this, like day in and day out, it was no big deal and now...” and I'm feeling it too. It's not just them, I'm feeling it too like oh my gosh, I haven't worked this hard in two years. And it's hard to get back into that mode. So I feel like we will eventually get there, because I have those expectations and I know that they know what it feels like and I still keep like reminding them that this is nowhere near what we used to do before pandemic. But after your body hasn't done that in a long time, and after you haven't been in that mode, yeah it's a shock and not a very pleasant one sometimes [laugh]."
Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah, I can imagine. In the news in the last couple of years there's been an increase in reports of violence against Asian Americans. Is that's something that's affected you at all, or what do you think about that?"
Participant,"Um that's a really interesting question. It hasn't affected me here in the job, in the in the workplace. But during the pandemic—and this is such a sidebar [Interviewer] I don't even know like if you're interested in this part, so you could just cut me off if you're not. But during the pandemic like we had to find other things to do right, like you couldn't go do your normal things. And I started working out in a gym that did like outdoor exercises. And I had to go a little bit further away from my little place where I live to do these things and I met up with a bunch of Asians. Like when I ventured out to like the Duluth area, a little bit further south, a little bit further east, there's a huge Asian population, right, that's not up here in Forsyth. And so, all my friends then became Asian. And I had never had Asian friends before my life like I grew up in a very rural, country area I was the only Asian and there was one other like African American kid. So when they initially said ‘Well let's go out for to celebrate.’ it was somebody's birthday, and I was in a crowd with like 12 other Asians. It crossed my mind that, ‘Are we going to be a target for whatever restaurant that we go to and how is that going to be perceived and am I in any sort of danger?’ That was the first time I had that thought, because I had never sat in a crowd of Asians, I didn't even have an Asian friend until then. And so yeah just COVID, new group of friends, new area within Atlanta, all this stuff happened, and so I do think about that from time to time. Um, and does it make me uncomfortable? Yeah, yeah, anywhere anytime you go in a large group with Asians, I feel like we could potentially not be welcome. I don't know what to do about it except just be aware."
Interviewer,yeah sure.
Participant,It’s weird.
Interviewer,No it's not weird. That's a totally rational feeling so.
Participant,"yeah and you know, the only the only other time I've been with an Asian is with my brother when we go do something and it's usually in a place where it's like all White people and we're just Asian and we—I grew up thinking I was White until I was like six years old, so I didn't know any different."
Interviewer,um is there anything else about work or your workplace or your different careers that we haven't discussed that you would want to talk about.
Participant,"No, but I did want to ask you if you think I'm the anomaly."
Interviewer,in what sense?
Participant,"this is not the way, like, normal Asians grow up right, like?"
Interviewer,"um it depends, it really depends. I mean I've interviewed a couple people who were like fourth or fifth generation and so they don't feel particularly connected necessarily to like their Asian roots or whatnot um. But yeah I think it can go either direction, there are lots of people that you know it's just not that important to them being Asian or whatnot. If that’s what you mean."
Participant,"yeah that's what I wanted to know, because when we were growing—like when my parents brought us over here, my dad, it was really important for us to assimilate. And so, he wanted us to wear like American clothing and he wanted us to eat American food and learn how to use a fork and a knife and we that's why I don't—we worked really hard not to have an accent. And he didn't want us to be ostracized in any way or not have the same chances of getting a job, getting into school, getting friends, and all that kind of stuff so we practiced not having an accent at the dinner table. And so it was really important to fit in and I guess I just—I wanted to share that because that resonated with me. Whereas a lot of people come over and they don't either care about that or they don't want to assimilate or they want to preserve their culture, but I just grew up in a very different family lifestyle, where it was really important to embrace and take on the American way because that's what we were here for: the American dream. And so we were going to do it that way, so anyway."
Interviewer,"There have been a few people who've talked about being super Americanized or feeling like, you know, and they are they just said that, you know, maybe it's because I'm to American or maybe it's because I'm very Westernized or whatnot. So, I don't think you're that much of an anomaly for that, I think. I think it happens, a lot actually with immigrant families wanting to make sure that their kids grow up, you know, not feeling different so."
Participant,yeah or having a fair shake when it comes to getting a job or getting in school or something like that so...
Interviewer,Right sure.
Participant,That was it.
Interviewer,"Now that's a fair question, a really fair question."
Participant,Can I ask why you picked this topic.
Interviewer,"um it kind of came out of nowhere. I was reading a lot of literature on like emotion work or emotions in the workplace and there was a whole subsection of it specifically being different for people of different races. But they didn't have any information or any research on Asian Americans, which is common. Asian Americans are not featured in a lot of research, because they're just presumed to be you know, healthy and they're hard working, and so they do well educationally and they have good jobs, so why would we study them? Because a lot of people are looking for problems, right, and so yeah so there's not a whole lot of information about Asian Americans, so I knew I wanted to do some maybe related to that, but yeah so I don't know if that makes sense."
Participant,super interesting. Are you almost done with it?
Interviewer,"I'm getting there, I'm getting there. I still need some more people, so if you know anybody who would be interested, definitely let me know. I can send you a flyer. Oh, can I ask you a few questions, demographic questions that maybe didn't come up yet in our conversation?"
Participant,Sure.
Interviewer,"Okay you're located in Atlanta, and you grew up in California. Um do you mind telling me your age?"
Participant,"yeah, I'm 53, turning 54 this year."
Interviewer,"Okay, and your ethnic background’s Japanese and okay. Yeah those were my questions, I just wanted to make sure that I got through them all."
Participant,"yeah absolutely I actually do have an Asian friend that I met in North Carolina that, I think she's Chinese but she's adopted, would she qualify for your report for"
Interviewer,"Sure, yeah, yeah."
Participant,I will see whether or not she would make yourself available.
Interviewer,"Okay yeah that'd be great, and you can give her my contact info and yeah that'd be awesome."
Participant,"Okay, all right anything else I'm so sorry about the interruptions that is just uncharacteristic for me."
Interviewer,"Actually, let me stop this recording."
