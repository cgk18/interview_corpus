Unknown,Participant 12
Unknown,"Allison S: Perfect, um so my first question for you is just do you mind introducing yourself and tell me a little bit about who you are, where you're from, and your education and employment history?"
Participant,"Yeah, so my name is Participant 12. I grew up in the San Gabriel Valley. I went to UC Irvine for undergrad and studied economics and I graduated in the year of 2017, so I've been out of school for five years now. So, I've been in the corporate workforce for the past couple years. I started at Edwards Life Sciences as an inventory analyst and was there for two years, then I switched jobs and joined Capital group in 2019 as a business solution design analyst. Long word for a business analyst. And then I have been there ever since, so I'm at capital group now."
Participant,"Allison S: And so, what does a business analyst do exactly? Can you tell me a little bit more about your role there?"
Participant,"Yeah so um, it's funny because the team, the way that they describe themselves to other teams in the company is like “we're internal consultants.” And so pretty much like the org that we support, the organization that we support, we help them solve problems. And so, mine was in the investment operations function, and so it's very operations based, and we tried to understand like certain processes and figure out where we could um... where we could help solve the issues and make it more like a streamlined process."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure um, can you tell me a little bit more about Capital group as well? Like what kind of company is it? What size? And yeah, like what is it like working there?"
Participant,"Yeah, so capital group is a wealth management company, so they sell like mutual funds, a lot of different big companies go to them and buy 401K plans for their employees, so they are a wealth management firm. What is it like working there? I've been there for three years now. They're a really big company, a lot of people stay there for a really long time, like the retention rate is really high because their retirement plan is really, what's it called... like beneficial for people. So, like a lot of people stay because they put a lot of money into your retirement plan and so like people retire from- like work there until they retire pretty much. And they've been around for, I want to say 90 years, like they started up in the 30s so super old company and it was like created by some white guys so like a lot of the different portfolio managers that work there are all white males pretty much, yeah. I will say the company's really big, and they’re global."
Participant,"Allison S: Um with your particular office, like what is it...  Is it all white males there too, or is it like more diverse than that?"
Participant,"Um I will say it's a mix. I think, yeah. I will... So where do I start? So, my three years at capital, I was in a different team for two and a half years and I recently switched roles, and so my previous role, that team I would say is pretty diverse in terms of like the make-up of the people like race and gender as well, and then now switching over to this new team, which is more marketing and sales, there are more white men and women. So yeah, I will say it's diverse, but the higher you go up in the leadership chain like you'll see less diversity and more like white people."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure, and do you have any sense of why that would be or just happens to be that way?"
Participant,"I think it just happens to be that way, like they are trying to diversify because like with this whole George Floyd thing happening a couple years ago, their push for DE&I has been like org wide, and so they are trying to not enforce it, but really ask people to think about how to diversify the leadership group. So, I mean it’s still early on to say, but I’m not sure like how that's going, but I know that it’s something that they're keeping in mind."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure, yeah. Um do you like your job, and what do you like about it, and if you could rate it on a scale from one to 10, what would you give it?"
Participant,"Um it's tough to say because I just joined the team, the team that I just switched to for like a month or so, but so far based off the meetings that I have been a part of, it seems like something that I want to do. So if I were to rate it it's probably like an eight and a half, out of ten, but we'll see if that answer changes in the next year or so."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure, what about your previous role, what would you give that?"
Participant,"It’s um... I would say, on average, was probably like a seven, and I say that because I started that role thinking like it was what I wanted to do, like it was a project type of role, compared to my time at Edwards it was very like repetitive, so I felt like I wasn't learning much. But then, when I started this new - the previous role at Capital Group, I felt like I was being challenged a little bit more and learning a lot of different things and then that started to plateau like after a couple of years, and then my manager also just I didn't feel like he was super supportive and wasn't like helping me grow in my career so that's what was a big turnoff for me as well and that's what made me want to switch teams."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure, sure. Um how is your current team and like how many people do you work with on a regular basis?"
Participant,"I would say based off the meetings that I've been on, it's probably like 10 to 15 people that i've been on calls with. So I would - it consists of like people from IT, my team, and a couple of like external consultants as well."
Participant,"Allison S: Do you ever work with clients or customers, or is it mostly just internal?"
Participant,It's mostly internal.
Participant,"Allison S: Got it um, what are the people that you work with like? Are you friends with them, or is it just pretty business professional? Are they similar age and race, gender, to you, or what's that like?"
Participant,"Um... They are not the same age as me, I would say I'm probably the youngest of the people that I've worked with, and then in terms of race, the developers are actually all Vietnamese and it feels like family because they remind me of like my uncles and then, yeah. So, in terms of age-wise like I'm the youngest, but they're a lot... they’re like middle-aged men, but they are Vietnamese and then there's a couple of Indians as well."
Participant,"Allison S: got it. Are you the only girl on the team, or woman on a team?"
Participant,"Um no, I am one of three on my direct team, and then the other two are like external consultants."
Participant,"Allison S: Got it um, can you tell me a little bit more about like the workplace culture or what the overall like vibe or atmosphere is like, or the mood at your workplace?"
Participant,"Um let's see I will... um they're very... It's hard to say because, like this new team that I'm on, I haven't gotten a sense of what their culture is like yet, but based off of what I've observed, the vibes I guess it's pretty casual, and I will say it's because my senior manager that I work with is a young Indian American woman and so she's like... and that's rare because at Capital Group, a lot of the senior leaders are much older white male like I said, and so she's very direct and it's just like when she talks to people it's like you're talking to a friend, but she also like gets things done, so that's kind of the tone that she sets with the people that we work with that I've noticed. So I will say it's like casual and friendly, but also like “hey we gotta like get work done” type of vibes."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure, sure. Um do you consider the people that you work with your friends? Or maybe the people that you used to work with, or just they're specifically your colleagues and that's kind of where you draw the line."
Participant,"I tried to make friends with the people I work with because I think that's what makes work enjoyable, and it's typically the people who are around my age that I make friends with. So, I haven't found that yet on my current team, but on my previous team, I did have friends that I like still keep in touch with now that I'm on this new team. So yeah, it depends on their age and also how I get along with them as well."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure, yeah. That makes sense. Um do you feel like, with your colleagues or coworkers or whatnot, you can talk to them about anything? Or do you feel like there are certain lines that you shouldn't cross?"
Participant,"um I think there's certain lines I shouldn't cross, and it depends on the relationship I have with them. So like, the people that I've become friends with, I have like monthly one-on-ones with them where we just talk about anything and everything about life and like I'll ask her about, I don't know, her honeymoon that's coming up or their house purchase, or any of the remodeling things like very casual like things that you would catch up with a friend with. But then the more senior people I keep more of like a surface-level, professional type of relationship with them."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure, sure. What would you say, do you feel like there are, you know, implicit unspoken rules about what you're allowed to discuss with your coworkers or are there like expectations around that at all?"
Participant,"Um if there are implicit rules, I'm definitely not following them. It's just like the people that I become friends with I feel super comfortable and I think it's just me, like I am one to just open up easily if I feel comfortable and so then, once that like barrier is down, I can just talk to anyone about anything. But then, yeah with the older people it's not as like I wouldn't cross that line to talk about like things that I would talk to my younger friends at work."
Participant,"Allison S: Yeah that makes sense, do you ever vent to your colleague or listen to them vent to you?"
Participant,"All the time. Yes, all the time, I think within my previous team with my manager, I used to complain about him a lot to this friend and she also kind of worked with him as well, so like her and I were on the same project together. She's a couple years older than me. And so she- And she was a couple years older than me, so I - she was like the project lead, and I like worked with her and looked up to her for guidance a lot. So when we would work with the manager, like her and I would vent to each other all the time and that's what made work kind of bearable."
Participant,"Oh shoot did I lose you? I'm having a hard time hearing you. Oh there, I can hear you now."
Participant,"Allison S: Better? Yeah, sorry about that. Okay um what were we talking about? You were telling me about your manager, I think, and your friend venting."
Participant,"Oh yeah, yeah. So I do - it depends on the relationship I have with them, but typically it's the people I feel comfortable with sharing every.... It's like the people I just talk to anything and everything about, those are the people I tend to vent to."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure, yeah. That makes sense, um. Can you tell me a little bit more about you as an emotional person? Like I'm interested in how people feel and express their emotions at work so it's helpful to know like whether you're an emotional person or not, and if you express your emotions really freely, or if you tend to keep them like reserved private?"
Participant,"Yeah, um I am a super emotional person and that's just like outside of work as well, and so that I think carries into my work environment. And so like this manager that I'm talking about, like working with him was extremely frustrating, and so there were times where like I think my frustration showed, and we had a one-on-one and like he was telling me like certain directions, and I just wasn't understanding. So then, I remember crying during the one-on-one but thankfully the camera was off, and so like he was just talking the whole time and I was just like silently crying to myself because I was so annoyed with him and just like everything. And even when I would get like upset or frustrated like I think it's really hard for me to control that, especially when speaking to a manager, I think like you're supposed to keep yourself buttoned up and like be super professional, but I noticed that sometimes it would slip if I'm frustrated. On the opposite end, if I get super excited about something, it's also like very visible too. So yeah, I will say I like am a person who wears my heart on my sleeve, inside and outside of work for better or worse."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure. Oh so, are you working from home mostly? Is it like remote work?"
Participant,"It's hybrid. So the example I just expressed to you was during the peak of COVID, and so we were like at home. Now I'm in the office twice a week and so those... and this team tends to turn their cameras on more versus like my previous team is like: “if you don't feel comfortable, then you don't have to.” But yeah, so the example I provided was like during COVID."
Participant,"Allison S: Do you find it easier or harder or just different being in person versus being, you know, remote and having your camera on versus not?"
Participant,"um I think it's easier, in a sense that like I get to know people better and just like getting to know everybody just through like casual conversation when you're in the office is so much easier than having to set a meeting up when you're at home and then logging on to do that. It just - it doesn't feel as like, natural. Yeah, if I were to like say which is better and which one I would prefer, even though I don't really like going into the office because the drive there like is what I um…. what's the word I'm looking for? Like I don't look forward to driving into the office, but when I get there it's fine. So yeah, I would prefer going into the office to meet people better especially like, I just joined my team. I just feel more comfortable when I get to know people in person, more than like getting to know people virtually. I don't feel as motivated to like, message people to like talk to them when I'm at home."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure, yeah. That makes sense, um... can you think of any times when you felt particularly emotional at work, and this could be any kind of emotion, so like super nervous or happy or upset or frustrated?"
Participant,"Yeah, all of the above. Felt all the above. But what would you like to know about it, like yeah?"
Participant,"Allison S: What was the context, like tell me the story?"
Participant,"Oh, there's plenty of like nervousness feelings, especially when I'm about to present to like leadership people. So I get like, super like...everything you can think about when you're about to present to like leads, like you're sweaty and then you're super nervous and feel like you to throw up, so I've had all those feelings. The frustration, like working with someone who is difficult to work with, so like the manager I told you about. And then also being excited about like the work, I think event like -  when I joined the Capital Group teams, I did a lot of- how I met people when I first joined was did a lot of event planning and team building stuff and so that's how I was able to like socialize and get to know people better. I was just planning things that we could get a big group together, so those are like exciting times for me, and then also just like going to happy hours with people was also exciting too."
Participant,"Allison S: Tell me a little bit more about getting frustrated with your manager from before, like what did he do that was like super frustrating, and like what did you do to cope with that?"
Participant,"Yeah I think just, working on that project with him just felt like an eternity because for the longest time we weren't sure what we were trying to solve for and so... And then I felt like as a manager, he didn't know what direction we were heading in either, so like it just felt like we were just in this cyclical confusing time together. And then - but then he wouldn't admit that he didn't know what he was doing, so he would pretend like he knew what he was doing and then try to provide me feedback on like how he thinks I should do work, but in my head, I was like: “I don't even think you know where we're going with this.” So then, it felt like um... I just, I don't know, didn't respect like his leadership style. And so then he would bring us into meetings for like “clarity”, but then me and the girl that I told you about, we would end up leaving the call like even more confused than we had entered the call. So then, it was an accumulation and months and months of like that kind of working style, and that led up to the one-on-one with him, where he was telling me like: “oh you're not doing enough, and you know you’re like what you're doing...” He was pretty much saying like, the way that I'm going about things isn't correct without providing direction and feedback as to like how I could be doing things better, and so that was like just super frustrating, and then it made me feel incompetent and like I wasn't doing my job right. So it's just like all of that... all those months of working with him had led up to that point."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure, so what did you do at the time to like try to cope with that frustration and whatnot?"
Participant,"I immediately, so it was a one on one with him, and then I immediately pinged my friend that also worked with this manager, and I was just like: “You won’t believe what just happened.” And so like, I just like vented to her immediately. And then I went to a nice dinner with my boyfriend after because I was just so frustrated. Yeah so, he took me out to like make me feel better."
Participant,Allison S: Did you have to – Was it really difficult to like hide how you were feeling during the meeting or during meetings of your...?
Participant,"For sure. And I think like he sensed that something was wrong because I was just like extremely quiet. I was just like “okay, okay”, like just not saying anything else without that word. And so, after like I got myself together, I was like “okay, I'll do as you said,” like whatever instruction he gave I was just like “I'll go ahead and do that”. And then luckily, the call was already ending so I just didn't push anything else. I was just like: “alright, well talk to you later,” and then I hung up."
Participant,Allison S: Did you ever express any of your frustration during any of the meetings with your manager?
Participant,Like talk to him about it?
Participant,"Allison S: Yeah, or just show it in some ways?"
Participant,"Um yes, I think. I would like sigh audibly loud, not intentionally, I would just like be really frustrated like “ugh, okay.” And then just be like “alright, I think I know what to do,” or whatever, and then he would hear that and be like “oh sorry, like I know...” I think people have also talked to him about what he does is like really confusing and frustrating, so he would remember that he's doing that and then say like “oh sorry, I know, like I'm not doing this right,” or whatever. But then it was like a lot of that in several calls, so he would catch himself doing it and then change for like five seconds, and then go back to his old ways. So yeah, there were plenty of times where I showed my frustrations."
Participant,Allison S: Was your manager like... What age was your manager and what race?
Participant,"He was probably early 40s and Asian American. So, in a sense, like as a manager he, I don't think he just knew how to look out for me and like manage me and like help me grow. But then I always tell my friends and peers about him like, as a friend he'd be really cool. I could talk to him about life matters and, like we would talk about like personal finance things and sports and all that, like on a on a very casual surface level stuff like he's a cool person. But as a manager, someone who you're looking to for guidance on like where to go on a certain project, it was just like I would not go to him for any of that in the future."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure. Um can you think of any other times, where you maybe feel particularly emotional at work?"
Participant,"Yeah I think, um when I was applying for this current role that I'm in right now, there was a lot of stress going into that. Oh, and it also had to do with this manager. So like. I was expressing to him: “hey I want- I'm like thinking of exploring different opportunities.” Sorry my dog just came in. I was telling him I wanted to explore different opportunities and then, I personally think like he took it offensively that I wanted to leave the team and so his reaction to that wasn't super supportive either. He was just like: “you need to think about what our current team can provide you and if it's exactly the same, like you should consider staying.” It wasn't like: “yeah sure, go ahead and apply.” And it wasn't the reaction that I wanted because: one, I wanted to like leave a position where I didn't feel like I was growing anymore, and also leave him as a manager. So I was like “I just need to get out of here.” And that conversation was also like a weird one, like we had the camera on, my face was like super pissed off and annoyed and I think he sensed it because, after that call, I called my mentor and I was complaining to him about this guy, my manager. And he told me that my manager also called him to like talk about the conversation we had, and so we both knew that like we left the conversation in not good terms. So then, he set up a call later that day with me to like apologize for how that conversation went and he was pretty much apologizing for like not being supportive, not listening to me, and just already reacting to what I was trying to do for my career. So, I think after that conversation things kind of went better, but I was still like... I still wanted to leave the team and him as a manager. So that conversation was where I also showed like frustration. I was just like: “I don't necessarily agree with everything you're saying,” and like I was like talking through like gritted teeth. But I was like:“Yeah I'll think about it, and then I'll get like get back to you”. So I ultimately still applied, but then after the second conversation where he apologized, he was more supportive and encouraging for my transition to this new role."
Participant,Allison S: That's good.
Participant,"Yeah, it was uncomfortable though. I think that was like the most uncomfortable conversations I've had with like a manager."
Participant,"Allison S: Yeah, sure, sure. Um do you ever feel emotionally exhausted or experience like burnout at work?"
Participant,"Yeah all the time. Oh, actually not all the time, I will say it comes and goes. And I think I felt it, I felt disengaged, especially when I felt stuck, like I didn't know what to do with my current - previous role I was in. I’m like really fed up with this manager, the work isn't engaging anymore, I don't feel like I'm being challenged. So it was during that time, where I just felt like I don't know how to move forward from this, and then I just felt like I didn't want to do anything, like I just like... I dreaded turning signing on to work every day. And then, after leaving work I'd be extremely frustrated because sometimes the days would end with calls with that manager talking about like how to move forward on the project, and it would be like hours long. So it'd be like mentally exhausting after talking to him too. Yeah, I think that was when I was feeling the most negative, I would say. And just working with him was just like exhausting. I think, like me being a negative Nancy complaining to like all the close friends that I have at work about him added on to the feeling of burnout and disengagement. And so, it got up until a certain point where I was like “I need to leave.” And then there was the roles that opened up that I wanted to apply for where I was like: “okay I'm going to take the jump now.” So yeah, those are rough times."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure. Did you feel like you had to, you know, psych yourself up to like act sort of different when you were feeling this way?"
Participant,"Oh yeah um. Yeah, I had to tell myself like... Yeah it depended on who I talked to that helped me think that way, so like when I would talk to my boyfriend he was like “it's all about your perspective” and so, then... Once I - and it took like a lot of work for me to change that mindset, because I was just stuck in the whole like complaining mode versus thinking like: “hey this might be an opportunity for you to learn how to work with the different manager.” Like this isn't someone I'm going to be working with forever and so, if you switch like... flip the switch to think that way, it's not as bad. But it had to take a lot of work for me to think that way. And then I would have to pretend that I liked my manager as a manager too, and so during one-on-ones, we would like catch up and like just talk about anything like as a friend, but when it came to project work, I was just very... I don't know, I didn't feel safe telling him like how I personally felt about his management style either, and so it wasn't until I wrote in my review for him, where I was kind of more giving him concrete feedback of what he could do better, as a manager. But yeah, to answer your question, I did have to like fake feeling like I enjoyed the work with him."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure, yeah. Was that difficult to do?"
Participant,"Yeah it was. And then when it - and I would try to stay away from like project conversation too. Like if we just talked about like life events, that was fine I could completely feel like myself. And then once we talked about project worker, I was like: “Okay, crap. Now I have to talk about like actual work stuff with him.”"
Participant,"Allison S: Sure. In general, do you feel like you can be yourself at work or do you feel like you have to like act different?"
Participant,"Yeahm I feel like I could be myself. Yeah I - sometimes like I have said, like really awkward things and then I would feel like really embarrassed that I would say some things after that. And then I would like ruminate over the things that I said that were really awkward. So, I guess that just shows, like, I am able to be myself and sometimes have to like check myself to make sure I'm not like, I don’t know, being awkward. Yeah, so I will - the answer is yes, I do feel like I am myself at work most of the time."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure, yeah. Yeah um do you ever feel like your race or your gender or your age impacts how you're viewed at work?"
Participant,"Yeah I would say so, I feel like most of the people I work with are much older than me and so it's not so much like they don't respect me. And I myself feel like I am still learning so like I don't hold - I don't talk with that much authority. It's more so, like “hey I'm curious and want to learn.” Whereas, like the people who I work with they're like: “oh you're so young, in your career like let me guide you, show you, talk to you,” like because they see how young I am. And I personally haven't experienced like sexism or anything like that, but the female leaders that I've talked to keep coaching and providing like advice to say like make sure your voice is loud and like make sure you're speaking up during meetings, because xyz. Like this will help you grow in your career and like you're surrounded by men all the time, like don't let them just dismiss you. So I've had women leaders come and like provide that advice. Men as well, like, I have had a - he’s I think Indian – but like in his middle high 30s and he would tell like “hey because you're so young, because you're an Asian female like don't let people step all over you and like you have to advocate for yourself.” Um so and I feel like it's like because I know I have to do that, it makes me feel even more like “oh crap I have to like do the extra work to like help me grow in my career,” so it's like always in the back of my head now that people have said that to me."
Participant,Allison S: Do you like that they told you that advice or do you kind of wish that they hadn’t?
Participant,"um I think I appreciate it and now I know what to look out for, but then it adds extra level of like pressure that I have to consider now when I think about my career. And then it makes me wonder too, like do other women colleagues like get this kind of advice as well? And I’m sure like there's so much... so many factors that go into that as well, like you're an Asian woman, I wonder if like white women feel this way, but then the thing that we do have in common is being women ourselves, and so it makes me just like question how other women are going about this too."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure, so when you - when you think about this advice in the back of your head does that alter how you act in like meetings or at work?"
Participant,"So yeah, I would say, I would say I am more like intentional about how I respond to certain things. Like when we're talking about work stuff I try to like sound more professional and not as like, how do I say this...like casual, I guess. So yeah, in that sense, like I do find myself changing how I talk, yeah."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure, do you feel like you'd also change how often you talk, or when you talk, or no?"
Participant,"I haven't yet. I tend to not speak up in meetings and that like advice tells me that I should, but then because right now I’m just like in a lot of meetings where I’m just observing, I'm not talking a lot yet. But I think in the coming months, with me taking on more work in my current role I probably will have to more. But I think it helps that -  for some reason it feels more comfortable being in these meetings with them, and I can't figure it out what it is yet, but I feel like if I were to like voice my opinion I wouldn't feel as timid, or like self-conscious speaking up. I don't know, I think it's also just a way that they talk amongst each other that I've seen. People are just open to spitting out ideas versus in my previous role it didn't feel that way, for I don't know why... I think, maybe just like the manager I worked with had a certain point of view of how things should be, whereas this current team like anything -  anyone could say anything and we would like to talk about it."
Participant,"Allison S: So yeah, yeah. No, that makes sense. Are the like Asian race and gender demographics of your previous team different from the one that you have now?"
Participant,"I would say they're about the same. In my previous team, I was also one of the younger ones and I'm the youngest one here too. But I will say, yeah, age and demographics wise are probably the same, like my manager is an Indian woman and she immigrated here when she was in like high school, so she has that like immigrant story type of culture. So I feel like - but because she's a woman, I resonate with her more than my old Asian American male manager."
Participant,"Allison S: Sure, yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Do you ever feel like you've experienced any kind of discrimination or racial comments or stereotyping at work?"
Participant,"I remember - and I still think back to this example all the time, like we went out - it was my first time joining the company so like they treated all the new joiners out to lunch one time. And then, I was like - I think that the typical way to use a knife and fork is like your knife is supposed to be in your left hand and your fork is supposed to be on your right but I switched it, I think, or whatever the proper way is, I had it flipped. And then, one of the managers noticed that and he was like: “Where are you from?” And then I took it really offensively, but then he kind of like provided more context, he was like “oh I'm asking because, like Europeans switch the way they eat,” and so - but I was like “what the heck, why are you asking me that?” It was such a weird question. I was like: “I was born here.” Like I kind of like said it in that way, like a very defensive tone, and then he was like: “Oh no, no, no, like I'm not asking you like that type of like - it was because you're using utensils weird.” And so, I was just like: “Oh.” Um, so in that sense, like that was the first time I've ever been asked that question, and I was surprised to be asked that question at work. But in terms of like other examples, I can't think of any. Yeah I can't think of any, but that was like... that was it for me."
Participant,"Allison S: Yeah, yeah sure. Um the person who had asked this was not Asian or?"
Participant,"No, he was like a white male."
Participant,"Allison S: Yeah, yeah. Is there anything else about your job or about work that we haven't discussed that you would want to talk about?"
Participant,"I feel like in terms of career growth in corporate America, it's just a weird thing to think about because of the intersectionality of like your race, gender, your cultural background and all that, and I feel like my company is trying to get better about understanding the differences that people bring to the table. But I've heard just very differing opinions about that, like now people get promoted because they're a person of color and not - or it may seem that way because they're trying to like check the box for their DE&I thing, and I'm struggling to figure out like, is it okay to be a diversity promotion slash hire? I'm still wrapping my head around that like is it -  and that's what I felt when I joined this team as well, I knew there was a white guy who's also like the same age same level of like - we were on the same level of in terms of like professional career trajectory. And when I got the role and I heard that he didn't, I was like: “Is it because I'm an Asian female and like you're just trying to diversify your team, or is it because you actually hired me based off of like my performance and merit?” So there's like those types of things where I'm struggling to wrap my head around still. I'm not sure what to do about it yet, but I will say, like, I think it has to do with me being an Asian woman and like also just taking into consideration like upbringing and all of that. Those are things I like think about from time to time."
Participant,"Allison S: What about your upbringing, do you think about? Like in terms of that."
Participant,"Yeah like my parents were immigrants too. Like their level of education probably doesn't exceed high school and so then moving to the states like they - me being born here, I felt like the child of immigrant parents, like having to figure things out on my own, and then I wonder like - I mean I know that adds to how I carry myself and like the confidence that I have with a lot of things. But yeah, it's just like taking those into consideration versus like comparing me to my peers, who have had parents who work, who have corporate experience or whatever, and wondering like how they navigate - how they think about their career too. And if they had just think that it'll come to them versus me thinking: “Oh, I have to work for it.” Like that kind of thing."
Participant,Allison S: Sure. What kind of jobs do your parents do?
Participant,"My dad - both parents are jewelers, they're in the jewelry industry, like they make necklaces and stuff. For the longest time,my mom was a stay-at-home mom until my sisters and I were like old enough to take care of ourselves and then she went and helped my dad with work."
Participant,Allison S: Got it.
Participant,And they don't have to like speak English or anything.
Participant,"Allison S: Oh, are your parents - your parents are from Vietnam or?"
Participant,"Yeah they're from Vietnam. Technically we’re like Chinese by blood, but culturally, we are Chinese-Vietnamese from my family side yeah."
Participant,"Allison S: Gotcha, okay. That makes sense. Yeah, so these are most of my questions. I did have one more question about like with the pandemic and with some of the news lately about like anti-Asian violence and stuff, has that impacted you at all or have you felt any differently because of that?"
Participant,"Yeah, I think it's made - It's brought it more to my attention than I would have like, you know thought about like, before COVID happened it wasn't really a thing. But I mean I knew that - I knew people experienced racism and discrimination and stuff like that, but now it's like talked about all the time and work talks about it too. Like when the like -all the Asian violence was happening, our DE&I like, Asian community held like a forum for people to come and talk and share about their experiences and like - just people don't normally talk about it, but then they finally talked about at work and like one woman had her uncle like beat up and he actually died, like they hit him with a rock or whatever. So, like that was extremely hard to listen to and then having to go back to work after that was like really difficult."
Participant,Allison S: Because it was like in the middle of the workday?
Participant,"Yeah, it was like a lunch meeting. And so, I was like talking to my manager about it and I was like: “How do people just go back to work thinking everything's okay again?” So I think they talk about it more, like there's more awareness. It's sad, I don't like - because it's being talked about all the time, it's like heavy to listen to and stuff. And now I'm like, when my parents go out, I tell them to be careful. They don't bring their phones when they like go out and walk and so it makes me nervous. When like something were - if something were to happen, they don't have anyone to call or like they can’t even call because their phones are not on them. So, it's just like hyper-awareness of like those situations now."
Participant,"Allison S: Yeah, yeah that makes sense. A few demographic questions that I think most of these have already come up, but you're located in southern California and you grew up in southern California as well? Can you tell me your - did you tell me your age already?"
Participant,No. I don't think so. I'm 27.
Participant,"Allison S: 27. Okay, like (name)."
Participant,Yeah.
Participant,"Allison S: Cool, and can you tell me your gender pronouns?"
Participant,I’m female.
Participant,Allison S: Okay cool um.
Participant,She/Her.
Participant,"Allison S: Yeah no, yeah, no that's fine. I just want to make sure that I get it right, if I like, you know, talk about anybody. Well, so that's pretty much all my questions. I don't know if there's anything else you wanted to talk about."
Participant,"Yeah I guess, what like - with this research that you're doing like, what are you hoping to get out of it?"
Participant,"Allison S: You know, so I went in with a really like broad scope and open mind about it because I don't want to like enforce a narrative that’s not there. So, I tried to keep my questions like fairly like broad and general if I could. And then just follow up, based on like what people say. So I think I'm just interested in general, like about Asian Americans experiences at work. There is some research on that, but not a whole lot. And I know that, you know, obviously especially in the recent climate, like people talk a little bit more - been more open about talking about race and having an impact on your work and your experiences and your trajectory. And then I'm also interested in like the emotional piece, just like, do people express their emotions at work? Like when they do, what is that like? Are they carrying additional like emotional labor because they you know have these other things going on, so that sort of thing. I'm just kind of just generally looking at that."
Participant,"Okay, that's cool. Is there any way we could like, keep engaged with like your research and everything too?"
Participant,"Allison S: Yeah, yeah sure. Um so, at some point I will write something, and I would be more than happy to send that out if you're interested. But also, I know I talked to your boyfriend about this, but um yeah if there are other questions or other things that come up that I’m like interested in, I can also like reach out and -"
Participant,Oh yeah.
Participant,Allison S: If you'd be interested in in response to those things too so.
Participant,"Yeah, yeah. Of course, yeah I'd be interested in doing that."
